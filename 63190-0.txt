PROVERBS OF ALL NATIONS.




                       PROVERBS OF ALL NATIONS,

    "Even the best proverb, though often the expression of the widest
    experience in the choicest language, can be thoroughly misapplied.
    It cannot embrace the whole of the subject, and apply in all cases
    like a mathematical formula. Its wisdom lies in the ear of the
    hearer."--FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.

PREFACE.


ENGLISH LITERATURE, in most departments the richest in Europe, is yet
the only one in which there has hitherto existed no comprehensive
collection of proverbs adapted to general use. To supply this
deficiency is the object of the present attempt.

Dean Trench, in the preface to his "Proverbs and their Lessons,"
adverts to "the immense number and variety of books bearing on the
subject;" but adds, that among them all he knows not one which
appears to him quite suitable for all readers. "Either," he says,
"they include matter which cannot fitly be placed before all--or they
address themselves to the scholar alone; or, if not so, are at any
rate inaccessible to the mere English reader--or they contain bare
lists of proverbs, with no endeavour to compare, illustrate, or explain
them--or, if they do seek to explain, they yet do it without attempting
to sound the depths or measure the real significance of that which they
attempt to unfold."

My own experience in this department of literature is entirely in
accordance with these views. I have, therefore, during the preparation
of the following pages, kept constantly before my mind the Dean of
Westminster's precise statement of things to be done, and things to be
avoided.

British proverbs for the most part form the basis of this collection.
They are arranged according to their import and affinity, and under
each of them are grouped translations of their principal equivalents in
other languages, the originals being generally appended in footnotes.
By this means are formed natural families of proverbs, the several
members of which acquire increased significance from the light they
reflect on each other. At the same time, a source of lively interest
is opened for the reader, who is thus enabled to observe the manifold
diversities of form which the same thought assumes, as expressed in
different times and by many distinct races of men; to trace the unity
in variety which pervades the oldest and most universal monuments of
opinion and sentiment among mankind; and to verify for himself the
truth of Lord Bacon's well-known remark, that "the genius, wit, and
spirit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs."

Touching as they do upon so wide a range of human concerns, proverbs
are necessarily associated with written literature. Sometimes they are
created by it; much oftener they are woven into its texture. Personal
anecdotes turn upon them in many instances; and not unfrequently they
have figured in national history, or have helped to preserve the memory
of events, manners, usages, and ideas, some of which have left little
other record of their existence. From the wealth of illustration thus
inviting my hand, I have sought to gather whatever might elucidate
and enliven my subject without overlaying it. In this way I hope to
have overcome the general objection alleged by Isaac Disraeli against
collections of proverbs, on the ground of their "unreadableness." It is
true, as he says, that "taking in succession a multitude of insulated
proverbs, their slippery nature resists all hope of retaining one in
a hundred;" but this remark, I venture to believe, does not apply
to the present collection, in which proverbs are not insulated, but
presented in orderly, coherent groups, and accompanied with appropriate
accessories, so as to fit them for being considered with some
continuity of thought.

PROVERBS OF ALL NATIONS.


WOMEN, LOVE, MARRIAGE, ETC.


  =What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.=

This is an Englishwoman's proverb. The Italian sisterhood complain
that "In men every mortal sin is venial; in women every venial sin is
mortal."[1] These are almost the only proverbs relating to women in
which justice is done to them, all the rest being manifestly the work
of the unfair sex.

    =If a woman were as little as she is good,
    A peascod would make her a gown and a hood.=

This is Ray's version of an Italian slander.[2] The Germans say,
"Every woman would rather be handsome than good;"[3] and that,
indeed, "There are only two good women in the world: one of them is
dead, and the other is not to be found."[4] The French, in spite of
their pretended gallantry, have the coarseness to declare that "A man
of straw is worth a woman of gold;"[5] and even the Spaniard, who
sometimes speaks words of stately courtesy towards the female sex,
advises you to "Beware of a bad woman, and put no trust in a good
one."[6]

    "The crab of the wood is sauce very good
      For the crab of the sea;
    But the wood of the crab is sauce for a drab,
      That will not her husband obey."

    =A spaniel, a woman, and a walnut tree,=
    =The more they're beaten the better they be.=

There is Latin authority for this barbarous distich.[7] The Italians
say, "Women, asses, and nuts require rough hands."[8] Much wiser is the
Scotch adage,--

  =Ye may ding the deil into a wife, but ye'll ne'er ding him out
  o' her.=

The French make the rule more general--"Take a woman's first advice,
&c."[9] There is good reason for this if the Italian proverb is
true, "Women are wise offhand, and fools on reflection."[10] They
have less logical minds than men, but surpass them in quickness of
intuition, having, says Dean Trench, "what Montaigne ascribes to
them in a remarkable word, _l'esprit prime-sautier_--the leopard's
spring, which takes its prey, if it be to take it at all, at the first
bound." "Summer-sown corn and women's advice turn out well once in
seven years,"[11] say the Germans; and the Spaniards hold that "A
woman's counsel is no great thing, but he who does not take it is a
fool."[12] In Servia they say, "It is sometimes right even to obey a
sensible wife;" and they tell this story in elucidation of the proverb.
A Herzegovinian once asked a Kadi whether a man ought to obey his
wife, whereupon the Kadi answered that he needed not to do so. The
Herzegovinian then continued, "My wife pressed me this morning to bring
thee a pot of beef suet, so I have done well in not obeying her." Then
said the Kadi, "Verily, it is sometimes right even to obey a sensible
wife."

  =It's nae mair ferlie to see a woman greet than to see a guse gang
  barefit.=--_Scotch._

That is, it is no more wonder to see a woman cry than to see a goose
go barefoot. "Women laugh when they can, and weep when they will."[13]
This is a French proverb, translated by Ray. Its want of rhyme makes it
probable that it was never naturalised in England. The Italians say, "A
woman complains, a woman's in woe, a woman is sick, when she likes to
be so,"[14] and that "A woman's tears are a fountain of craft."[15]

  =A woman's mind and winter wind change oft.=

"Women are variable as April weather" (German).[16] "Women, wind, and
fortune soon change" (Spanish).[17] Francis I. of France wrote one day
with a diamond on a window of the château of Chambord,--

    "Souvent femme varie:
    Bien fou qui s'y fie."

    "A woman changes oft:
    Who trusts her is right soft."

His sister, Queen Margaret of Navarre, entered the room as he was
writing the ungallant couplet, and, protesting against such a slander
on her sex, she declared that she could quote twenty instances of man's
fickleness. Francis retorted that her reply was not to the point, and
that he would rather hear one instance of woman's constancy. "Can
you mention a single instance of her inconstancy?" asked the Queen
of Navarre. It happened that a few weeks before this conversation a
gentleman of the court had been thrown into prison upon a serious
charge; and his wife, who was one of the queen's ladies in waiting, was
reported to have eloped with his page. Certain it was that the page
and the lady had fled, no one could tell whither. Francis triumphantly
cited this case; but Margaret warmly defended the lady, and said that
time would prove her innocence. The king shook his head, but promised
that if, within a month, her character should be re-established, he
would break the pane on which the couplet was written, and grant his
sister whatever boon she might ask. Many days had not elapsed after
this, when it was discovered that it was not the lady who had fled with
the page, but her husband. During one of her visits to him in prison
they had exchanged clothes, and he was thus enabled to deceive the
jailer, and effect his escape, while the devoted wife remained in his
place. Margaret claimed his pardon at the king's hand, who not only
granted it, but gave a grand fête and tournament to celebrate this
instance of conjugal affection. He also destroyed the pane of glass,
but the calumnious saying inscribed on it has unfortunately survived.

  =A woman's tongue wags like a lamb's tail.=

  =A woman's strength is in her tongue.=--_Welsh._

  =Arthur could not tame a woman's tongue.=--_Welsh._

"Three women and three geese make a market,"[18] according to the
Italians. "Foxes are all tail, and women are all tongue;" at least, it
is so in Auvergne.[19] "All women are good Lutherans," say the Danes;
"they would rather preach than hear mass."[20] "A woman's tongue is her
sword, and she does not let it rust," is a saying of the Chinese.

  =Swine, women, and bees are not to be turned.=

  ="Because" is a woman's answer.=

And not so unmeaning an answer as flippant critics imagine. It is
an example of that much-admired figure of speech, aposiopesis, and
means--because I will have it so. "What a woman wills, God wills"
(French).[21] "Whatever a woman will she can" (Italian).[22]

    "The man's a fool who thinks by force or skill
    To stem the torrent of a woman's will;
    For if she will, she will, you may depend on't,
    And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't."

The cunning of the sex is equal to their obstinacy. "Women know a
point more than the devil" (Italian).[23] What wonder, then, if "A bag
of fleas is easier to keep guard over than a woman?" (German).[24] The
wilfulness of woman is pleasantly hinted at in the Scotch proverb,
"'Gie her her will, or she'll burst,' quoth the gudeman when his wife
was dinging him."

  =A woman conceals what she does not know.=

  =Women and bairns lein [conceal] what they kenna.=--_Scotch._

"To a woman and a magpie tell what you would speak in the market-place"
(Spanish).[25] Hotspur says to his wife,--

                  "Constant you are,
    But yet a woman, and for secrecy
    No lady closer; for I well believe
    Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,
    And so far I will trust thee, gentle Kate."

But, if there is truth in proverbs, men have no right to reproach women
for blabbing. A woman can at least keep her own secret. Try her on the
subject of her age.

  =Beauty draws more than oxen.=

"One hair of a woman draws more than a bell-rope" (German).[26]

  "And beauty draws us with a single hair."


  =Beauty buys no beef.=

  =Beauty is no inheritance.=

In spite of these curmudgeon maxims, let no fair maid despair whose
face is her fortune, for "She that is born a beauty is born married"
(Italian).[27]

  =Beauty is but skin deep.=

The saying itself is no deeper. It is physically untrue, for beauty
is not an accident of surface, but a natural result and attribute
of a fine organisation. A man may sneer, like Ralph Nickleby, at a
lovely face, because he chooses rather to see "the grinning death's
head beneath it;" but Ralph was a heartless villain, and that is
only another name for a fool. "Beauty is one of God's' gifts," says
Mr. Lewes, "and every one really submits to its influence, whatever
platitudes he may think needful to issue.... How, think you, should
we ever have relished the immortal fragments of Greek literature, if
our conception of Greek men and Greek women had been formed by the
contemplation of figures such as those of Chinese art? Would any pulse
have throbbed at the Labdacidan tale had the descendants of Labdacus
risen before the imagination with obese rotundity, large ears, gashes
of mouths, eyes lurching upwards towards the temples, and no nose to
speak of? Could we with any sublime emotions picture to ourselves Fo-Ti
on the Promethean rock, or a Congou Antigone wailing her unwedded
death?"

  =Fine feathers make fine fowls.=

Therefore, "If you want a wife choose her on Saturday, not on Sunday"
(Spanish);[28] _i.e._, choose her in undress. "No woman is ugly
when she is dressed" (Spanish);[29] at least, she is not so in her
own opinion. "The swarthy dame, dressed fine, decries the fair one"
(Spanish).[30]

  =The fairer the hostess the fouler the reckoning.=

"A handsome landlady is bad for the purse" (French);[31] for this among
other reasons--that "If the landlady is fair, the wine too is fair"
(German).[32]

  =A bonny bride is sune buskit.=--_Scotch._

Buskit--dressed. She needs little adornment to enhance her charms.

  =Joan is as good as my lady in the dark.=

  =When candles are out all cats are grey.=

"Blemishes are unseen by night,"[33] says an ancient Latin proverb;
and the Greeks held that "When the lamp is removed all women are
alike."[34] Opinions may differ on that point, but all agree that

                          "The night
    Shows stars and women in a better light."

Hence the Italian warning to choose "Neither jewel, nor woman, nor
linen by candlelight;"[35] and the French hyperbole, "By candlelight a
goat looks a lady."[36]

  =If Jack is in love he is no judge of Jill's beauty.=

"Nobody's sweetheart is ugly" (Dutch).[37] "Never seemed a prison fair
or a mistress foul" (French).[38] "Handsome is not what is handsome,
but what pleases" (Italian).[39] "He whose fair one squints says she
ogles" (German).[40] "'Red is Love's colour,' said the wooer to his
foxy charmer" (German).[41]

  =Love is blind.=

Blind to all imperfections in the beloved object; blind also to
everything around it--to facts, consequences, and prudential
considerations. "People in love think that other people's eyes are out"
(Spanish).[42]

  =It is hard to keep flax from the lowe [fire].=-_Scotch._

"Man is fire, woman tow, and the devil comes and blows" (Spanish).[43]

  =Glasses and lasses are bruckle [brittle] wares.=--_Scotch._

  =A pretty girl and a tattered gown are sure to find some hook in the
  way.=

Italy appears to be the original country of this proverb, though it is
popularly current in Ulster. "A handsome woman and a pinked or slashed
garment" are the things mentioned in the Italian proverb.[44] The
French form[45] corresponds with the Irish.

  =Where love fails we espy all faults.=

  =Faults are thick where love is thin.=--_Welsh._

  =Hot love is soon cold.=

  =Love me little, love me long.=

  =Love of lads and fire of chats are soon in and soon
  out.=--_Derbyshire._

Chats, _i.e._, chips.

  =Lads' love's a busk of broom, hot a while and soon
  done.=--_Cheshire._

  =Love is never without jealousy.=

"He that is not jealous is not in love," says St. Augustin;[46] but
that depends not only upon the disposition of the lover, but upon the
point arrived at in the history of his love. Doubts and fears are
excusable in one who has not yet had assurance that his passion is
returned, but afterwards "Love expels jealousy" (French),[47] or, at
least, it ought to do so. "Love demands faith, and faith steadfastness"
(Italian);[48] but too often "Love gives for guerdon jealousy and
broken faith" (Italian).[49] It is an Italian woman's belief that "It
is better to have a husband without love than with jealousy."[50]

  =No folly to being in love.=--_Welsh._

"To love and to be wise is impossible" (Spanish);[51] or, as an
antique French proverb says, the two things have not the same
abode.[52] This is the creed of those who have not themselves been
lovers. As Calderon sings, in lines admirably rendered by Mr.
Fitzgerald,--

    "He who far off beholds another dancing,
    Even one who dances best, and all the time
    Hears not the music that he dances to,
    Thinks him a madman, apprehending not
    The law which moves his else eccentric action;
    So he that's in himself insensible
    Of love's sweet influence, misjudges him
    Who moves according to love's melody;
    And knowing not that all these sighs and tears,
    Ejaculations and impatiences,
    Are necessary changes of a measure
    Which the divine musician plays, may call
    The lover crazy, which he would not do,
    Did he within his own heart hear the tune
    Play'd by the great musician of the world."

  =They that lie down [i.e., fall sick] for love should rise for
  hunger=.--_Scotch._

The presumption being that, if they had not been too well fed, they
would not have been troubled with that disease. "Without Ceres and
Bacchus, Venus freezes" (Latin).[53] "No love without bread and wine"
(French).[54]

  =Old pottage is sooner heated than new made.=

An old flame is sooner revived than a new one kindled. "One always
returns to one's first love" (French).[55] "True love never grows
hoary" (Italian).[56]

  =Love and light cannot be hid.=

  =Love and a cough cannot be hid.=

The French add smoke to these irrepressible things.[57] _La gale_ is
sometimes enumerated with them; and the Danes say, "Poverty and love
are hard to hide."[58]

  =Love and lordship like not fellowship.=

  =Kindness comes awill.=--_Scotch._

That is, love cannot be forced. The Germans couple it in that respect
with singing.[59] "Who would be loved must love,"[60] say the Italians;
and "Love is the very price at which love is to be bought."[61]

Our English proverbs on love are for the most part sarcastic or
jocular, and few of them can be compared, for grace and elevation of
feeling, with those of Italy. We have no parallels in our language
for the following:--"Love knows no measure"[62]--there are no
bounds to its trustfulness and devotion;--"Love warms more than a
thousand fires;"[63]--"He who has love in his heart has spurs in his
sides;"[64]--"Love rules without law;"[65]--"Love rules his kingdom
without a sword;"[66]--"Love knows not labour;"[67]--"Love is master
of all arts."[68] The French have one proverb on the sovereign might
of love,[69] which they borrowed from the sublime phrase in the Song
of Solomon, "Love is stronger than death;" and another expressed in
the language of their chivalric forefathers, "Love subdues all but the
ruffian's heart."[70]

  =Marry in haste and repent at leisure.=

This proverb probably came to us from Italy;[71] but, alas! it happens
too often in all countries that "Wedlock rides in the saddle, and
repentance on the croup" (French).[72] There is a joke in the Menagiana
not unlike this:--A person meeting another riding on horseback with his
wife behind him, applied to him the words of Horace--"Post equitem
sedet atra cura."[73] "Marriage is a desperate thing," quoth Selden.
"The frogs in Æsop were extremely wise; they had a great mind to some
water, but they would not leap into the well because they could not
get out again." Consider well, then, what you are about before you put
yourself in a condition to hear it said,--

  =You have tied a knot with your tongue you cannot undo with
  your teeth.=

Some go so far as to say that "No one marries but repents"
(French).[74] The Spaniards exclaim, in language which reminds us of
the custom of Dunmow, "The bacon of paradise for the married man that
has not repented!"[75]

  =Better wed over the mixon than over the moor.=

The mixon is the heap of manure in the farmyard. The proverb means that
it is better not to go far from home in search of a wife--advice as
old as the Greek poet Hesiod, who has a line to this effect: "Marry,
in preference to all other women, one who dwells near thee." But a
more specific meaning has been assigned to the English proverb by
Fuller, and after him by Ray and Disraeli. They explain it as being a
maxim peculiar to Cheshire, and intended to dissuade candidates for
matrimony from taking the road to London, which lies over the moorland
of Staffordshire. "This local proverb," says Disraeli, "is a curious
instance of provincial pride, perhaps of wisdom, to induce the gentry
of that county to form intermarriages, to prolong their own ancient
families and perpetuate ancient friendships between them." This is a
mistake, for the proverb is not peculiar to Cheshire, or to any part of
England. Scotland has it in this shape:--

  =Better woo o'er midden nor o'er moss.=

And in Germany they give the same advice, and also assign a reason
for it, saying, "Marry over the mixon, and you will know who and what
she is."[76] The same principle is expressed in different forms in
other languages, _e.g._, "Your wife and your nag get from a neighbour"
(Italian).[77] "He that goes far to marry goes to be deceived or
to deceive" (Spanish).[78] The politic Lord Burleigh seems to have
regarded this "going far to deceive" as a very proper thing to be done
for the advancement of a man's fortune. In his "Advice to his Son" he
says, "If thy estate be good, match near home and at leisure; if weak,
far off and quickly." There is an ugly cunning in that word _quickly_.
Burleigh's advice is quite in the spirit of the French fortune
hunter's adage, "In marriage cheat who can."[79]

  =He that loseth his wife and sixpence hath lost a tester.=

"He that loseth his wife and a farthing hath a great loss of his
farthing" (Italian).[80] In Italy also, and in Portugal, it is said
that "Grief for a dead wife lasts to the door;"[81] and even in
Provence, the land of the troubadours, they have a rhyme to this
effect:--

    "Two good days for a man in this life:
    When he weds and when he buries his wife."[82]

Nor do the wives of Provence appear to be delighted with their conjugal
lot. Having lost their youthful plumpness through the cares and toils
of wedlock, they oddly declare that "If a stockfish became a widow
it would fatten."[83] A Spanish woman's opinion of matrimony is thus
expressed: "'Mother, what sort of a thing is marriage?' 'Daughter, it
is spinning, bearing children, and weeping.'"[84]

  =Better a tocher [dower] in her than wi' her.=--_Scotch._

  =A man's best fortune or his worst is his wife.=

"The day you marry you kill or cure yourself" (Spanish).[85] "Use
great prudence and circumspection," says Lord Burleigh to his son, "in
choosing thy wife, for from thence will spring all thy future good or
evil; and it is an action of life like unto a stratagem of war, wherein
a man can err but once."

    =The gude or ill hap o' a gude or ill life
    Is the gude or ill choice o' a gude or ill wife.=--_Scotch._

There is a Spanish rhyme much to the same effect:--

    "Him that has a good wife no evil in life that may not be borne,
                                                         can befall.
    Him that has a bad wife no good thing in life can chance to,
                                        that good you may call."[86]

  =Put your hand in the creel, and take out either an adder or an eel.=

That's matrimony. "In buying horses and taking a wife, shut your eyes
and commend yourself to God" (Italian).[87] "Marriages are not as they
are made, but as they turn out" (Italian).[88]

  =There's but ae gude wife in the country, and ilka man thinks he's
  got her.=--_Scotch._

It is a pleasant delusion while it lasts, and it is not incurable.
Instances of complete recovery from it are not rare.

  =A man may woo where he will, but must wed where he's
  weird.=--_Scotch._

That is, where he is fated to wed. This is exactly equivalent to the
English saying,--

  =Marriages are made in heaven=,

the meaning of which Dean Trench appears to me to mistake, when he
speaks with admiration of its "religious depth and beauty." I cannot
find in it a shadow of religious sentiment. It simply implies that it
is not forethought, inclination, or mutual fitness that has the largest
share in bringing man and wife together. More efficient than all these
is the force of circumstances, or what people vaguely call chance,
fate, fortune, and so forth. In the French version of the adage,
"Marriages are _written_ in heaven,"[89] we find the special formula
of Oriental fatalism; and fatalism is everywhere the popular creed
respecting marriage. Hence, as Shakspeare says,--

    "The ancient saying is no heresy--
    Hanging and wiving go by destiny."

"But now consider the old proverbs to be true y saieth: that marriage
is destinie."--_Hall's Chronicles._

  =If marriages be made in heaven some had few friends there.=--_Scotch._

  =Ne'er seek a wife till ye hae a house and a fire burning.=--_Scotch._

  =More belongs to a bed than four bare legs.=

  =Marriage is honourable, but housekeeping is a shrew.=

  =Sweetheart and honey-bird keeps no house.=

"Marry, marry, and what about the housekeeping?" (Portuguese).[90]
"Remember," said a French lady to her son, who was about to make an
imprudent match, "remember that in wedded life there is only one thing
which continues every day the same, and that is the necessity of making
the pot boil." "He that marries for love has good nights and bad days"
(French).[91] "Before you marry have where to tarry," (Italian);[92]
and remember that

  =A wee house has a wide throat.=

It costs something to support a family, however small; and "It is
easier to build two hearths than always to have a fire on one"
(German).[93]

  ='Tis hard to wive and thrive both in a year.=

  =Who weds ere he be wise shall die ere he thrive.=

  =Happy is the wooing that is not long a-doing.=

This is so far true as it discommends long engagements.

  ='Tis time to yoke when the cart comes to the capples [i.e.,
  horses].=--_Cheshire._

That is, it is time to marry when the woman wooes the man. This
provincial word "capple" is Irish also, and is allied to, but not
derived from, the Latin _caballus_. It is probably one of the few words
of the ancient Celtic tongue of Britain which were adopted into the
language of the Saxon conquerors.

  =Husbands are in heaven whose wives chide not.=

Whether or not that heaven is ever found on earth is a question which
each man must decide from his own experience. "He that has a wife has
strife,"[94] say the French, and the Italian proverb-mongers take an
unhandsome advantage of the fact that in their language the words
"wife" and "woes" differ only by a letter.[95] St. Jerome declares that
"Whoever is free from wrangling is a bachelor."[96]

  =A smoky chimney and a scolding wife are two bad companions.=

The Scotch couple together "A leaky house and a scolding wife," in
which they follow Solomon: "A continual dropping on a very rainy day
and a contentious woman are alike."[97] "It is better to dwell in a
corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house."[98]


  =A house wi' a reek and a wife wi' a reerd [scolding noise] will sune
  mak a man run to the door.=--_Scotch._

Of the continental versions of this proverb the Spanish[99] seems to me
the best, and next to it the Dutch.[100]

  =It's a sair reek where the gude wife dings the gude man.=--_Scotch._

"A man in my country," says James Kelly, "coming out of his house with
tears on his cheeks, was asked the occasion. He said 'there was a
sair reek in the house;' but, upon further inquiry, it was found that
his wife had beaten him." "It is a sad house where the hen crows and
the cock is mute" (Spanish).[101] Though we have not this proverb in
English, we have its spirit embodied in one word, HENPECKED, which is
peculiar to ourselves.

  =The grey mare is the better horse.=

The wife wears the breeches. "A hawk's marriage: the hen is the better
bird" (French).[102]

  =Marry above your match and you get a master.=

"In the rich woman's house she commands always, and he never"
(Spanish).[103] "Who takes a wife for her dower turns his back on
freedom" (French).[104] But every married man is in this plight, for

  "He that has a wife has a master."[105]

"He that's not sensible of the truth of this proverb," says James
Kelly, "may blot it out or pass it over."

    "As the good man saith, so say we;
    But as the good woman saith, so it must be."

  =Wedding and ill wintering tame both man and beast.=

"You will marry and grow tame" (Spanish).[106]

  =He that marries a widow and two daughters marries three stark
  thieves.=

  =He that marries a widow and two daughters has three back doors to his
  house.=

And "The back door is the one that robs the house" (Italian).[107]

  =Never marry a widow unless her first husband was hanged.=

Else the burden of an old Scotch song, "Ye'll never be like mine auld
gudeman," will be dinned in your ears day and night.

  =He that marries a widow will have a dead man's head cast in his dish.=

  =Happy is the wife who is married to a motherless son.=

"Uno animo omnes socrus oderunt nurus," says Terence; and this is
the common testimony of experience in all ages and countries. "The
husband's mother is the wife's devil" (German, Dutch).[108] "As long
as I was a daughter-in-law I never had a good mother-in-law, and as
long as I was a mother-in-law I never had a good daughter-in-law"
(Spanish).[109] "The mother-in-law forgets that she was a
daughter-in-law" (Spanish).[110] "She is well married who has neither
mother-in-law nor sister-in-law" (Spanish).[111] Men, too, do not
always regard their wives' mothers with tender affection, and some of
the many bitter sayings against mothers-in-law seem to be common to
both sexes. Such is this queer Ulster rhyme:--

    "Of all the ould women that ever I saw,
    Sweet bad luck to my mother in-law."

Also these Low German:--"There is no good mother-in-law but she that
wears a green gown;"[112] _i.e._, that is covered with the turf of the
churchyard;--"The best mother-in-law is she on whose gown the geese
feed;"[113] and this Portuguese, "If my mother-in-law dies, I will
fetch somebody to flay her."[114]

PARENTS AND CHILDREN.


  =Children are certain cares, but uncertain comforts.=

"Little children and headaches--great children and heartaches"
(Italian).[115] Nevertheless, "He knows not what love is that has not
children" (Italian).[116]

  =It is a wise child that knows his own father.=

Happily, as a French sage remarks, "One is always somebody's child, and
that is a comfort."[117] "The child names the father; the mother knows
him" (Livonian).

  =The mother knows best if the child be like the father.=

  =The mither's breath is aye sweet.=--_Scotch._

This proverb, which belongs exclusively to Scotland, appears to me
even more "exquisitely graceful and tender" than that German and
French proverb so justly admired by Dean Trench, "Mother's truth keeps
constant youth."[118] "There is no mother like the mother that bore
us" (Spanish).[119] "The child that gets a stepmother gets a stepfather
also" (Danish).[120]

  =The crow thinks her own bird the fairest.=

"Every mother's child is handsome" (German).[121] "No ape but swears
he has the finest children" (German).[122] "If our child squints, our
neighbour's child has a cast in both eyes" (Livonian).

  =As the old cock crows so crows the young=; _or_,
  =As the old cock crows the young cock learns=.

  =If the mare have a bald face the filly will have a blaze.=

  =Trot feyther, trot mither, how can foal amble?=--_Scotch._

Children generally follow the example of their parents, but imitate
their faults more surely than their virtues. Thus,--

  =A light-heeled mother makes a heavy-heeled daughter.=

Unless the mother transfers a part of her household cares to the
daughter, the latter will grow up in sloth and ignorance of good
housewifery. "A tender-hearted mother rears a scabby daughter" (French,
Italian).[123]

  =A child may have too much of its mother's blessing.=

Her foolish fondness may spoil it.

  =The worst store is a maid unbestowed.=--_Welsh._

"A house full of daughters is a cellar full of sour beer" (Dutch).[124]
Chaucer says,--

    "He that hath more smocks than shirts in a bucking
    Had need be a man of good forelooking."

"Marry your son when you will, and your daughter when you can"
(Spanish).[125]

    =My son is my son till he's got him a wife;=
    =My daughter's my daughter all the days of her life.=

This is a woman's calculation. She knows that a son-in-law will submit
to her sway more tamely than a daughter-in-law.

  =Little pitchers have long ears.=

"What the child hears at the fire is soon known at the minster"
(French).[126]

  =Children and fools tell truth.=

And tell it when it were better left untold. "These terrible children!"
(French.)[127]

  =Children and fools have merry lives.=

They quickly forget past sorrows, and are careless of the future.

  =Children suck the mother when they are young, and the father when
  they are old.=

YOUTH AND AGE.


  =A ragged colt may make a good horse.=[128]

An untoward boy may grow up into a proper man. This may be understood
either in a physical or a moral sense. "There is no colt but breaks
some halter" (Italian),[129] otherwise it is good for nothing
(French).[130] "Youth comes back from far" (French).[131] Do not
despair of it as lost, though it runs a mad gallop; something of the
sort is to be expected of all but those preternaturally sedate youths
who are born, as the author of "Eothen" says, with a Chifney bit in
their mouths from their mother's womb.

  =A man at five may be a fool at fifteen.=

In the days when cock-fighting was a fashionable pastime, game chickens
that crowed too soon or too often were condemned to the spit as of
no promise or ability. "A lad," says Archbishop Whateley, "who has
to a degree that excites wonder and admiration the character and
demeanour of an intelligent man of mature years, will probably be
that and nothing more all his life, and will cease accordingly to be
anything remarkable, because it was the precocity alone that ever
made him so. It is remarked by greyhound fanciers that a well-formed,
compact-shaped puppy never makes a fleet dog. They see more promise in
the loose-jointed, awkward, and clumsy ones. And even so there is a
kind of crudity and unsettledness in the minds of those young persons
who turn out ultimately the most eminent."

  =Soon ripe soon rotten.=

"Late fruit keeps well" (German).[132]

  =It is better to knit than to blossom.=

Orchard trees may blossom fairly, yet bear no fruit.

  =It early pricks that will be a thorn.=

Some indications of future character may be seen even in infancy. The
child is father of the man.

  =Soon crooks the tree that good gambrel will be.=

A gambrel (from the Italian _gamba_, a leg) is a crooked piece of wood,
on which butchers hang the carcasses of beasts by the legs.

  =As the twig is bent the tree's inclined.=

  =Best to bend while it is a twig.=

  =It is not easy to straighten in the oak the crook that grew in the
  sapling.=--_Gaelic._

"What the colt learns in youth he continues in old age" (French).[133]
"What youth learns, age does not forget" (Danish).[134]

  =Reckless youth maks ruefu' eild.=--_Scotch._

"If youth knew! if age could!" (French).[135]

NATURAL CHARACTER.


  =What's bred in the bone will never be out of the flesh.=

What is innate is not to be eradicated by force of education or
self-discipline: these may modify the outward manifestations of a man's
nature, but not transmute that nature itself. What belongs to it "lasts
to the grave" (Italian).[136] The ancients had several proverbs to the
same purpose, such as this one, which is found in Aristophanes--"You
will never make a crab walk straight forwards"--and this Latin one,
which is repeated in several modern languages: "The wolf changes his
coat, but not his disposition;"[137]--he turns grey with age. The
Spaniards say he "loses his teeth, but not his inclinations."[138]
"What is sucked in with the mother's milk runs out in the shroud"
(Spanish).[139] Horace's well-known line,--

  "Naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret"--

"Though you cast out nature with a fork, it will still return"--has
very much the air of a proverb versified. The same thought is better
expressed in a French line which has acquired proverbial currency:--

  "Chassez le naturel, il revient au galop."

"Drive away nature, and back it comes at a gallop." This line is very
commonly attributed to Boileau, but erroneously. The author of it is
Chaulieu (?). The Orientals ascribe to Mahomet the saying, "Believe, if
thou wilt, that mountains change their places, but believe not that men
change their dispositions."

  =Cat after kind.=

"What is born of a hen will scrape" (Italian).[140] "What is born of
a cat will catch mice" (French, Italian).[141] This proverb is taken
from the fable of a cat transformed into a woman, who scandalised her
friends by jumping from her seat to catch a mouse. "A good hound hunts
by kind" (French).[142] "It is kind father to him," as the Scotch say.
"Good blood cannot lie" (French);[143] its generous instincts are sure
to display themselves on fit occasions. On the other hand, "The son of
an ass brays twice a day."[144] We need not say what people that stroke
of grave humour belongs to.

  =Drive a cow to the ha' and she'll run to the byre.=--_Scotch._

She will be more at home there than in the drawing-room. "A sow prefers
bran to roses" (French).[145] "Set a frog on a golden stool, and off it
hops again into the pool" (German).[146]

  =There's no making a silk purse of a sow's ear=;

or, "A good arrow of a pig's tail" (Spanish);[147] or, "A sieve of an
ass's tail" (Greek).

  =A carrion kite will never make a good hawk.=[148]

  =An inch o' a nag is worth a span o' an aver.=--_Scotch._

  =A kindly aver will never make a good nag.=--_Scotch._

An aver is a cart horse.

  =One leg of a lark is worth the whole body of a kite.=

  =A piece of a kid is worth two of a cat.=

  =Bray a fool in a mortar, he'll be never the wiser.=

"To wash an ass's head is loss of suds" (French).[149] "The malady that
is incurable is folly" (Spanish).[150]

  =There's no washing a blackamoor white.=

"Wash a dog, comb a dog, still a dog is but a dog" (French).[151]

  =A hog in armour is still but a hog.=

    =An ape is an ape, a varlet's a varlet,=
    =Though he be clad in silk and scarlet.=

  =There's no getting white flour out of a coal-sack.=

"Whatever the bee sucks turns to honey, and whatever the wasp sucks
turns to venom" (Portuguese).[152]

  =Eagles catch no flies.=

Literally translated from a Latin adage[153] much used by Queen
Christina, of Sweden, who affected a superb disdain for petty details.
The Romans had another proverbial expression for the same idea:--"The
prætor takes no heed of very small matters,"[154] for his was a
superior court, and did not try cases of minor importance. Our modern
lawyers have retained the classical adage, only substituting the word
"law" for "prætor." They say, "De minimis non curat lex," which might,
perhaps, be freely translated, "Lawyers don't stick at trifles."

HOME.


  =Home is home, be it ever so homely.=

  =Hame is a hamely word.=--_Scotch._

"Homely" and "hamely" are not synonymous, but imply different ideas
associated with home. The one means plain, unadorned, fit for every-day
use; the other means familiar, pleasant, dear to the affections. "To
every bird its nest is fair" (French, Italian).[155] "East and west,
at home the best" (German).[156] "The reek of my own house," says
the Spaniard, "is better than the fire of another's."[157] The same
feeling is expressed with less energy, but far more tenderly, in a
beautiful Italian proverb, which loses greatly by translation: "Home,
my own home, tiny though thou be, to me thou seemest an abbey."[158]
Two others in the same language are exquisitely tender: "My home, my
mother's breast."[159] How touching this simple juxtaposition of two
loveliest things! Again, "Tie me hand and foot, and throw me among my
own."[160]

  =Every cock is proud on his own dunghill.=

  =A cock is crouse on his ain midden.=--_Scotch._

This proverb has descended to us from the Romans: it is quoted
by Seneca.[161] Its medieval equivalent, _Gallus cantat in suo
sterquilinio_, was probably present to the mind of the first Napoleon
when, in reply to those who advised him to adopt the Gallic cock as
the imperial cognizance, he said, "No, it is a bird that crows on a
dunghill." The French have altered the old proverb without improving
it, thus: "A dog is stout on his own dunghill."[162] The Italian is
better: "Every dog is a lion at home."[163] The Portuguese give us the
counterpart of this adage, saying, "The fierce ox grows tame on strange
ground."[164]

  =An Englishman's house is his castle.=

But sanitary reformers tell him truly that he has no right to shoot
poisoned arrows from it at his neighbours. The French say, "The collier
(or charcoal burner) is master in his own house,"[165] and refer the
origin of the proverb to a hunting adventure of Francis I., which is
related by Blaise de Montluc. Having outridden all his followers, the
king took shelter at nightfall in the cabin of a charcoal burner, whose
wife he found sitting alone on the floor before the fire. She told him,
when he asked for hospitality, that he must wait her husband's return,
which he did, seating himself on the only chair the cabin contained.
Presently the man came in, and, after a brief greeting, made the king
give him up the chair, saying he was used to sit in it, and it was but
right that a man should be master in his own house. Francis expressed
his entire concurrence in this doctrine, and he and his host supped
together very amicably on game poached from the royal forest.

"Man," said Ferdinand VII. to the Duke of Medina Celi, the premier
nobleman of Spain, who was helping him on with his great coat,
"man, how little you are!"--"At home I am great," replied the
dwarfish _grande_ (grandee). "When I am in my own house I am a king"
(Spanish).[166]

PRESENCE. ABSENCE. SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.


  =Long absent, soon forgotten.=

  =Out of sight, out of mind.=

"Friends living far away are no friends" (Greek). "He that is absent
will not be the heir" (Latin).[167] "Absence is love's foe: far from
the eyes, far from the heart" (Spanish).[168] "The dead and the absent
have no friends" (Spanish).[169] "The absent are always in the wrong"
(French).[170] "Absent, none without fault; present, none without
excuse" (French).[171]

Against this string of proverbs, all running in one direction, we may
set off the Scotch saying,--

  =They are aye gude that are far awa'=;

and this French one: "A little absence does much good."[172] Without
affirming too absolutely that--

  =Friends agree best at a distance--=

which was a proverb before Rochefoucauld wrote it down among his
maxims--we may admit that "To preserve friendship a wall must be put
between" (French);[173] and that "A hedge between keeps friendship
green" (German).[174] "Love your neighbour, but do not pull down the
hedge" (German).[175] "There are certain limits of sociality, and
prudent reserve and absence may find a place in the management of
the tenderest relations."--(_Friends in Council._) This lesson the
Spaniards embody in two proverbs, bidding you "Go to your aunt's (or
your brother's) house, but not every day."[176] Friends meet with more
pleasure after a short separation. "The imagination," says Montaigne,
"embraces more fervently and constantly what it goes in search of than
what one has at hand. Count up your daily thoughts, and you will find
that you are most absent from your friend when you have him with you.
His presence relaxes your attention, and gives your thoughts liberty to
absent themselves at every turn and upon every occasion."

  =Better be unmannerly than troublesome.=

  =I wad rather my friend should think me framet than fashious.=--_Scotch._

That is, I would rather my friend should think me strange (_fremd_,
German) than troublesome (_fâcheux_, French).

  =Too much familiarity breeds contempt.=

  =Ower-meikle hameliness spoils gude courtesy.=

Hameliness means familiarity. See "Hame is a hamely word," page 36.

  =Leave welcome ahint you.=--_Scotch._

Do not outstay your welcome. "A guest and a fish stink on the third
day" (Spanish).[177]

  =Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.=

"Aweel, kinsman," says Rob Boy to the baillie, "ye ken our
fashion--foster the guest that comes, further him that maun gang." "Let
the guest go before the storm bursts" (German).[178]

  =If the badger leaves his hole the tod will creep into it.=--_Scotch._

"He that quits his place loses it" (French).[179] "Whoso absents
himself, his share absents itself" (Arab).

FRIENDSHIP.


  =He is my friend who grinds at my mill.=

That is, who is serviceable to me--a vile sentiment if understood too
absolutely; but the proverb is rather to be interpreted as offering
a test by which genuine friendship may be distinguished from its
counterfeit. "Deeds are love, and not fine speeches" (Spanish).[180]
"If you love me, John, your acts will tell me so" (Spanish).[181]
"In the world you have three sorts of friends," says Chamfort; "your
friends who love you, your friends who do not care about you, and your
friends who hate you."

  =Kindness will creep where it canna gang.=--_Scotch._

It will find some way to manifest itself, in spite of all hinderances.
As Burns sings,--

    "A man may hae an honest heart,
       Though poortith hourly stare him;
     A man may tak a neebor's part,
       Yet no hae cash to spare him."

  =Friendship canna stand aye on one side.=--_Scotch._

It demands reciprocity. "Little presents keep up friendship"
(French);[182] and so do mutual good offices. Note that the French
proverb speaks of _little_ presents--such things as are valued between
friends, not for their intrinsic value, but as tokens of good-will.

  =Before you make a friend, eat a peck of salt with him.=

Take time to know him thoroughly.

  =Sudden friendship, sure repentance.=

  =Never trust much to a new friend or an old enemy.=

Nor even to an old friend, if you and he have once been at enmity.
"Patched-up friendship seldom becomes whole again" (German).[183]
"Broken friendship may be soldered, but never made sound"
(Spanish).[184] "A reconciled friend, a double foe" (Spanish).[185]
"Beware of a reconciled friend as of the devil" (Spanish).[186]
Asmodeus, speaking of his quarrel with Paillardoc, says, "They
reconciled us, we embraced, and ever since we have been mortal enemies."

  =Old friends and old wine are best.=

"Old tunes are sweetest, and old friends are surest," says Claud
Halcro. "Old be your fish, your oil, your friend" (Italian).[187]

  =One enemy is too many, and a hundred friends are too few.=

Enmity is unhappily a much more active principle than friendship.

  =Save me from my friends!=

An ejaculation often called forth by the indiscreet zeal which damages
a man's cause whilst professing to serve it. The full form of the
proverb--"God save me from my friends, I will save myself from my
enemies"--is almost obsolete amongst us, but is found in most languages
of the continent, and is applied to false friends. Bacon tells us that
"Cosmos, Duke of Florence, was wont to say of perfidious friends that
we read we ought to forgive our enemies; but we do not read we ought to
forgive our friends."

  =A full purse never lacked friends.=

An empty purse does not easily find one. To say that "The best friends
are in the purse" (German),[188] is, perhaps, putting the matter a
little too strongly; but, at all events, "Let us have florins, and we
shall find cousins" (Italian).[189] "The rich man does not know who is
his friend."[190] This Gascon proverb may be taken in a double sense:
the rich man's friends are more than he can number; he cannot be sure
of the sincerity of any of them. "He who is everybody's friend is
either very poor or very rich" (Spanish).[191] "Now that I have a ewe
and a lamb everybody says to me, 'Good day, Peter'" (Spanish).[192]
Everybody looks kindly on the thriving man.

  =A friend in need is a friend indeed.=

But, as such friends are rare, the Scotch proverb counsels not amiss,--

  =Try your friend afore ye need him.=

On the other hand, "He that would have many friends should try few
of them" (Italian).[193] "Let him that is wretched and beggared try
everybody, and then his friend" (Italian).[194]

  =A friend is never known till one have need.=

"A friend cannot be known in prosperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden
in adversity" (Ecclesiasticus). "A sure friend is known in a doubtful
case" (Ennius)[195]

  =When good cheer is lacking, friends will be packing.=

"The bread eaten, the company departed" (Spanish).[196] "While the pot
boils, friendship blooms" (German).[197]

    "In time of prosperity friends will be plenty;
    In time of adversity not one in twenty."

  =No longer foster, no longer friend.=

  =Help yourself, and your friends will like you.=

"Give out that you have many friends, and believe that you have few"
(French).[198] By that means you will not expose yourself to be
bitterly disappointed, and you will secure the favours which the world
is ready to bestow on those who seem to have least need of them.

  =A friend at court is better than a penny in the purse.=

  =Kissing goes by favour.=

Every one makes it his business to "Take care of Dowb." "They are
rich," therefore, "who have friends" (Portuguese, Latin).[199]
"It is better to have friends on the market than money in one's
coffer" (Spanish).[200] "Every one dances as he has friends in the
ball-room" (Portuguese).[201] "There's no living without friends"
(Portuguese).[202]

CO-OPERATION. RECIPROCITY. SUBORDINATION.


  =One beats the bush and another catches the birds.=

_Sic vos non vobis._ The proverb is derived from an old way of fowling
by torchlight in the winter nights. A man walks along a lane, carrying
a bush smeared with birdlime and a lighted torch. He is preceded by
another, who beats the hedges on both sides and starts the birds,
which, flying towards the light, are caught by the limed twigs. An
imprudent use of this proverb by the Duke of Bedford, regent of
France during the minority of our Henry VI., has given it historical
celebrity. When the English were besieging Orleans, the Duke of
Burgundy, their ally, intimated his desire that the town, when taken,
should be given over to him. The regent replied, "Shall I beat the bush
and another take the bird? No such thing." These words so offended the
duke that he deserted the English at a time when they had the greatest
need of his help to resist the efforts of Charles VII.

Here the proverb was used to imply an unfair division of spoil, or what
was called, in the duchy of Bretagne, "A Montgomery distribution--all
on one side, and nothing on the other."[203] (The powerful family of
Montgomery were in the habit of taking the lion's share.) It may also
be applied to the manner in which confederates play into each other's
hands. "The dog that starts the hare is as good as the one that catches
it" (German).[204]

  =The receiver is as bad as the thief.=

"He sins as much who holds the sack as he who puts into it"
(French).[205] "He who holds the ladder is as bad as the burglar"
(German).[206]

  =Lie for him and he'll swear for you.=

  =Speir at Jock Thief if I be a leal man.=--_Scotch._

"Ask my comrade, who is as great a liar as myself" (French).[207]

  =The lion had need of the mouse.=

The grateful mouse in the fable rescued her benefactor from the toils
by gnawing the cords. "Soon or late the strong needs the help of the
weak" (French).[208] "Every ten years one man has need of another"
(Italian).[209]

  =Two to one are odds at football.=

"Not Hercules himself could resist such odds" (Latin).[210] "Three
helping each other are as good as six" (Spanish).[211] "Three brothers,
three castles" (Italian).[212] "Three, if they unite against a town,
will ruin it" (Arab).

  =When two ride the same horse one must ride behind.=

And, furthermore, he must be content to journey as the foremost
man pleases. "He who rides behind does not saddle when he will"
(Spanish).[213] The question of precedence is settled in this case by
another English proverb:--

  =He that hires the horse must ride before.=

The man who hires or owns the horse is Capital, and Labour must ride
behind him. In other cases the question will often have to be decided
by force.

  =You stout and I stout, who shall carry the dirt out?=

"You a lady, I a lady, who is to drive out the sow?" (Gallegan).[214]

  =Tarry breeks pays no fraught.=--_Scotch._

  =Pipers don't pay fiddlers.=

"One barber shaves another" (French).[215] "One hand washes the other"
(Greek).[216] "One ass scratches another" (Latin).[217]

  =Ka me, ka thee.=--_Scotch._

  =Turn about is fair play.=

LUCK. FORTUNE. MISFORTUNE.


  =Luck is all.=

A desperate doctrine, based on that one-sided view of human affairs
which is expressed in Byron's parody of a famous passage in Addison's
_Cato_:--

    "'Tis not in mortals to command success;
    But do you more, Sempronius--_don't_ deserve it;
    And take my word you'll have no jot the less."

"The worst pig gets the best acorn" (Spanish).[219] "A good bone
never falls to a good dog" (French);[220] and "The horses eat oats
that don't earn them" (German).[221] But this last proverb has also
another application. "Other rules may vary," says Sydney Smith, "but
this is the only one you will find without exception--that in this
world the salary or reward is always in the inverse ratio of the duties
performed."

  =The more rogue the more luck.=

  =The devil's children have the devil's luck.=

But their prosperity is false and fleeting. "The devil's meal runs half
to bran" (French).[222]

  =God sends fools fortune.=

It is to this version of the Latin adage, _Fortuna favet fatuis_
("Fortune favours fools"), that _Touchstone_ alludes in his reply to
_Jacques_:--

                          "'No, sir,' quoth he;
    'Call me not fool till Heaven hath sent me fortune.'"

The Spaniards express this popular belief by a striking figure: "The
mother of God appears to fools."[223] The Germans say, "Fortune and
women are fond of fools;"[224] and the converse of this holds good
likewise, since "Fortune makes a fool of him whom she too much favours"
(Latin);[225] and so do women sometimes. When we consider how much what
is called success in life depends on getting into one of "the main
grooves of human affairs," we can account for the common remark that
blockheads thrive better in the world than clever people, and that
"Jack gets on by his stupidity" (German).[226] It is all the difference
of going by railway and walking over a ploughed field, whether you
adopt common courses or set up one for yourself"--which is most likely
to be done by people of superior abilities. "You will see * * * * most
inferior persons highly placed in the army, in the church, in office,
at the bar. They have somehow got upon the line, and have moved on
well, with very little original motive powers of their own. Do not let
this make you talk as if merit were utterly neglected in these or other
professions--only that getting well into the groove will frequently do
instead of any great excellence."[227] With this explanation we are
prepared to admit that there is some reason in the Spanish adage, "God
send you luck, my son, and little wit will serve your turn."[228]

  =It is better to be lucky than wise.=

  =It is better to be born lucky than rich.=

  =Hap and ha'penny is warld's gear eneuch.=--_Scotch._

"The lucky man's bitch litters pigs" (Spanish).[229]

  =Happy go lucky.=

  =The happy [lucky] man canna be harried.=--_Scotch._

The lucky man cannot be ruined. Seeming disasters will often prove
to be signal strokes of good fortune for him. Such a man will have
cause to say, "The ox that tossed me threw me upon a good place"
(Spanish).[230]

  =He is like a cat, he always falls on his feet.=

  =Cast ye owre the house riggen, and ye'll fa' on your
  feet.=--_Scotch._

  =Give a man luck, and throw him into the sea.=

"Pitch him into the Nile," say the Arabs, "and he will come up with a
fish in his mouth;" and the Germans, "If he threw up a penny on the
roof, down would come a dollar to him."[231]

  =What is worse than ill luck?=

  =An unhappy man's cart is eith to tumble.=--_Scotch._

That is, easily upset. It happens always to some people, as Coleridge
said of himself, to have their bread and butter fall on the buttered
side. An Irishman of this ill-starred class is commonly supposed to
have been the author of the saying,--

  =He that is born under a threepenny planet will never be worth a
                                                          groat.=

  =If my father had made me a hatter men would have been born without
  heads.=

But the thought is not original in our language: an unlucky Arab
had long ago declared, "If I were to trade in winding-sheets no one
would die." A man of this stamp "Falls on his back and breaks his
nose" (French).[232] The Basques say of him, "Maggots breed in his
salt-box;" the Provençals, "He would sink a ship freighted with
crucifixes;" the Italians, "He would break his neck upon a straw."[233]

  =Misfortunes seldom come single.=

  =Misfortunes come by forties.=--_Welsh._

  =Ill comes upon waur's back.=--_Scotch._

"Fortune is not content with crossing any man once," says Publius
Syrus.[234] "After losing, one loses roundly," say the French.[235]
The Spaniards have three remarkable proverbs to express the same
conviction:--"Whither goest thou, Misfortune? To where there is
more."[236] "Whither goest thou, Sorrow? Whither I am wont."[237]
"Welcome, Misfortune, if thou comest alone."[238] The Italian
equivalents are numerous: _e.g._, "One ill calls another."[239] "One
misfortune is the eve of another."[240] "A misfortune and a friar are
seldom alone."[241]

  =It can't rain but it pours.=

Good fortune, as well as bad, is said to come in floods. "If the wind
blows it enters at every crevice" (Arab).

  =It is an ill wind that blows nobody good.=

There is a local version of this proverb:--

  =It is an ill wind that blows no good to Cornwall.=

On the rock-bound coasts of that shire almost any wind brought gain
to the wreckers. We have seen it somewhere alleged that the general
proverb grew out of the local one; but this is certainly not the fact,
for the former exists in other languages. Its Italian equivalent[242]
agrees closely with it in form as well as in spirit. The French say,
"Misfortune is good for something;"[243] the Spaniards, "There is no
ill but comes for good;"[244] and, "I broke my leg, perhaps for my
good."[245]

  =Our worst misfortunes are those that never befall us.=

"Never give way to melancholy: nothing encroaches more. I fight
vigorously. One great remedy is to take short views of life. Are you
happy now? Are you likely to remain so till this evening? or next week?
or next month? or next year? Then why destroy present happiness by a
distant misery which may never come at all, or you may never live to
see? For every substantial grief has twenty shadows, and most of them
shadows of your own making."--_Sydney Smith._

  =Ye're fleyed [frightened] o' the day ye ne'er saw.=--_Scotch._

  =You cry out before you are hurt.=

  =Never yowl till you're hit.=--_Ulster._

  =Let your trouble tarry till its own day comes.=

  =Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.=

In French, "À chaque jour suffit sa peine," words which were frequently
in Napoleon's mouth at St. Helena. An Eastern proverb says, "He is
miserable once who feels it, but twice who fears it before it comes."

  =When bale is highest, boot is nighest.=

"Bale" is obsolete as a substantive, but retains a place in current
English as the root of the adjective "baleful." The proverb means that

  =When the night's darkest the day's nearest.=

  =The darkest hour is that before dawn.=

  =When things come to the worst they'll mend.=

They must change, for that is the law of nature, and any change in them
must be for the better. Thus, "By dint of going wrong all will come
right" (French).[246] "Ill is the eve of well" (Italian);[247] and "It
is at the narrowest part of the defile that the valley begins to open"
(Persian). "When the tale of bricks is doubled Moses comes" (Hebrew).

  =He that's down, down with him.=

Such is the way of the world--"the oppressed oppressing." "Him
that falls all the world run over" (German).[248] "He that has ill
luck gets ill usage" (Old French).[249] "All bite the bitten dog"
(Portuguese).[250] "When a dog is drowning everybody brings him drink"
(French).[251]

  =Knock a man down, and kick him for falling.=

A sort of treatment like what they call in France "The custom of
Lorris: the beaten pay the fine."[252] It was enacted by the charter
of Lorris in the Orléanais, conferred by Philip the Fair, that any man
claiming to have money due to him from another, but unable to produce
proof of the debt, might challenge the alleged debtor to a judicial
combat with fists. The beaten combatant had judgment given against him,
which always included a fine to the lord of the manor.

  =The puir man is aye put to the warst.=--_Scotch._

"The ill-clad to windward" (French).[253]

  =The weakest goes to the wall=,

which is the worst place in a crowd and a crush. Also,

  =Where the dyke is lowest men go over=.

"Where the dam is lowest the water first runs over" (Dutch).[254]
People overrun and oppress those who are least able to resist.

  =When the tree falls every man goes with his hatchet.=

"When the tree is down everybody gathers wood" (Latin).[255] "If my
beard is burnt, others try to light their pipes at it" (Turkish).

  =Where the carcass is, the eagles will be gathered together.=

"'We are, then, irremediably ruined, Mr. Oldbuck?' (The speaker is Miss
Wardour, in the 'Antiquary.')

"'Irremediably? I hope not; but the instant demand is very large, and
others will doubtless pour in.'

"'Ay, never doubt that, Monkbarns,' said Sir Arthur; 'where the
slaughter is, the eagles will be gathered together. I am like a sheep
which I have seen fall down a precipice, or drop down from sickness:
if you had not seen a single raven or hooded crow for a fortnight
before, he will not be on the heather ten minutes before half a dozen
will be pecking out his eyes (and he drew his hand over his own), and
tearing out his heart-strings before the poor devil has time to die.'"

  =Put your finger in the fire and say it was your fortune.=--_Scotch._

Blame yourself only for the consequences of your own folly. Edgar, in
_Lear_, says, "This is the excellent foppery of the world! That when we
are sick in fortune we make guilty of our disasters, the sun, the moon,
and the stars: as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly
compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers, by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by a forced obedience of planetary
influence; and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on: an
admirable evasion!"

FORETHOUGHT. CARE. CAUTION.


  =Look before you leap.=

  =Don't buy a pig in a poke.=

A poke is a pouch or bag. This word, which is still current in the
northern counties of England, corresponds to the French _poche_, as
"pocket" does to the diminutive, _pochette_. _Bouge_ and _bougette_ are
other forms of the same word; and from these we get "budget," which,
curiously enough, has gone back from us to its original owners with a
newly-acquired meaning, for the French Minister of Finance presents his
annual Budget like our own Chancellor of the Exchequer. The French say,
_Acheter chat en poche_: "To buy a cat in a poke," or game bag; and the
meaning of that proverb is explained by this other one, "To buy a cat
for a hare."[256] So also the Dutch,[257] the Italian,[258] &c. The pig
of the English proverb is chosen for the sake of the alliteration at
some sacrifice of sense.

  =No safe wading in unknown waters.=

Therefore, "Swim on, and trust them not" (French).[259] "Who sees not
the bottom, let him not pass the water" (Italian).[260]

  =Beware of had I wist.=

  ="Had I wist," quoth the fool.=

"It is the part of a fool to say, 'I should not have thought it'"
(Latin).[261]

  =Stretch your arm no farther than your sleeve will reach.=

  =Never put out your arm further than you can easily draw it back again.=

Cautious Nicol Jarvie attributes to neglect of this rule the commercial
difficulties of his correspondent, Mr. Osbaldistone, "a gude honest
gentleman; but I aye said he was ane of them wad make a spune or spoil
a horn." Perhaps it is to ridicule the folly of attempting things
beyond the reach of our powers that the Germans tell us, "Asses sing
badly because they pitch their voices too high."[262]

  =Measure twice, cut but once.=

An irrevocable set should be well considered beforehand. Dean Trench
quotes this as a Russian proverb, but it is to be found in James
Kelly's Scottish collection, and is common to many European languages.

  =Second thoughts are best.=

Therefore it is well to "take counsel of one's pillow." "The morning
is wiser than the evening" (Russian), sometimes because--in Russia
especially--the evening is drunk and the morning is sober, but
generally because the night affords time for reflection. "The night
brings counsel" (French, Latin, German).[263] "Night is the mother of
thoughts" (Italian).[264] "Sleep upon it, and you will take counsel"
(Spanish).[265]

  =Raise nae mair deils than ye can lay.=--_Scotch._

  =Do not rip up old sores.=

"Nor stir up an evil that has been fairly buried" (Latin).[266]

  =Don't wake a sleeping dog.=

"When misfortune sleeps let no one wake her" (Spanish).[267]

  =To lock the stable door when the steed is stolen.=

"The wise Italians," says Poor Richard [Benjamin Franklin], "make
this proverbial remark on our nation--'The English feel, but they
do not see;' that is, they are sensible of inconveniences when they
are present, but do not take sufficient care to prevent them; their
natural courage makes them too little apprehensive of danger, so that
they are often surprised by it unprovided with the proper means of
security. When it is too late they are sensible of their imprudence.
After great fires they provide buckets and engines; after a pestilence
they think of keeping clean their streets and common sewers; and
when a town has been sacked by their enemies they provide for its
defence," &c. Other nations have their share of this after-wisdom,
as their proverbs testify: _e.g._, "To cover the well when the child
is drowned" (German).[268] "To stop the hole when the mischief is
done" (Spanish).[269] "When the head is broken the helmet is put on"
(Italian).[270] The Chinese give this good advice: "Dig a well before
you are thirsty." Be prepared for contingencies.

  =Be bail and pay for it.=

  =Afttimes the cautioner pays the debt.=--_Scotch._

"He that becomes responsible pays" (French).[271] "Whoso would know
what he is worth let him never be a surety" (Italian).[272]

  =In trust is treason.=

"In this world," said Lord Halifax, "men must be saved by their want
of faith." "He will never prosper who readily believes" (Latin).[273]
"Trust was a good man; Trust not was a better" (Italian).[274]

  =He should hae a lang-shafted spune that sups kail wi' the
  deil.=--_Scotch._

  =A fidging [skittish] mare should be weel girthed.=--_Scottish._

A cunning, tricky fellow should be dealt with very cautiously. "A
thief does not always thieve, but be always on your guard against him"
(Russian).

  =Fast bind, fast find.=

Shylock adds, "A proverb never stale to thrifty mind." "Who ties well,
unties well" (Spanish).[275] "Better is a turn of the key than a
friar's conscience" (Spanish).[276]

  =Grin when ye bind, and laugh when ye loose.=--_Scotch._

Tie the knot tightly, grin with the effort of pulling, and when you
come to untie it you will smile with satisfaction, finding it has kept
all safe.

  =Quoth the young cock, "I'll neither meddle nor make."=

He had seen the old cock's neck wrung for taking part with his master,
and the hen's for taking part with his dame.

PATIENCE. FORTITUDE. PERSEVERANCE.


  =Patience and posset drink cure all maladies.=

  =Patience is a plaster for all sores.=

We trace this proverb in an exquisite passage from "honest old Decker,"
as Hazlitt fondly calls him.

    "_Duke._ What comfort do you find in being so calm?

    _Candido._ That which green wounds receive from sovereign balm.
    Patience, my lord! why, 'tis the soul of peace;
    Of all the virtues 'tis nearest kin to heaven:
    It makes men look gods. The best of men
    That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer,
    A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit--
    The first true gentleman that ever breathed.
    The stock of patience, then, cannot be poor;
    All it desires it has: what award more?
    It is the greatest enemy to strife
    That can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs,
    And so chains up lawyers' and women's tongues.
    'Tis the perpetual prisoner's liberty--
    His walks and orchards; 'tis the bondslave's freedom,
    And makes him seem proud of his iron chain,
    As though he wore it more for state than pain;
    It is the beggar's music, and thus sings--
    Although their bodies beg, their souls are kings.
    O my dread liege! it is the sap of bliss
    Bears us aloft, makes men and angels kiss;
    And last of all, to end a household strife,
    It is the honey 'gainst a waspish wife."

"Patience, time, and money overcome everything" (Italian).[277] "He
who does not tire, tires adversity" (French).[278] "A stout heart
breaks ill luck" (Spanish).[279] "The remedy for hard times is to have
patience" (Arab).

  =Blaw the wind ne'er sae fast, it will lown at the last.=--_Scotch._

  =After a storm comes a calm.=

"After rain comes fine weather" (French).[280]

  =The longest day will have an end.=

  =Time and the hour run through the longest day.=

  =Be the day ne'er so long, at last comes even song.=[281]

"The day will be long, but there will be an end to it,"[282] said
Damiens of that dreadful day which was to witness his death by tortures
which are the eternal disgrace of the French monarchy.

  =When one door shuts another opens.=

When baffled in one direction a man of energy will not despair, but
will find another way to his object.

  =There is more than one yew bow in Chester.=

  =A' the keys of the country hang na in ae belt.=--_Scotch._

    "There are hills beyond Pentland, and streams beyond Forth;
    If there's lairds in the lowlands, there's chiefs in the north;
    There are wild duinewassels three thousand times three,
    Will cry hoich for the bonnet of Bonny Dundee!"

  =It is a sore battle from which none escape.=

One may suffer a great loss, and yet not be totally ruined.

  =There's as good fish in the sea as ever was caught.=

A consolatory reflection for those who have missed a good haul. The
question is, will they have industry and skill to do better another
time? "If I have lost the rings, here are the fingers still," is a
stout-hearted saying of the Italians and Spaniards.[283]

  =He that weel bides weel betides.=--_Scotch._

He that waits patiently comes off well at last, for "All comes right
for him who can wait" (French).[284] "Sit down and dangle your legs,
and you will see your revenge" (Italian);[285] that is, time will bring
you reparation and satisfaction. "The world is his who has patience"
(Italian).[286] "The world belongs to the phlegmatic" (Italian).[287]
"Have patience, Cossack; thou wilt come to be hetman" (Russian).

  =Set a stout heart to a stae brae [a steep hill side].=--_Scotch._

  =Set hard heart against hard hap.=

Go about a difficult business resolutely; confront adversity with
fortitude.

    "Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito
    Quam tua te fortuna sinit."

That you may not be easily discouraged, the French remind you that "One
may go far after he is tired."[288]

  =He that tholes [endures] overcomes.=--_Scotch._

  =The toughest skin holds longest out.=--_Cumberland._

"He conquers who sticks in his saddle" (Italian).[289] "Hard pounding,
gentlemen," said Wellington at Waterloo; "but we will see who will
pound the longest." "Perseverance kills the game" (Spanish).[290]

  =Constant dropping wears the stone.=[291]

  =A mouse in time may bite in two a cable.=

"With time and straw medlars ripen" (French).[292] "With time a
mulberry leaf becomes satin" (Chinese).

  =A rolling stone gathers no moss.=

This is an exact rendering of an ancient Greek adage, which is repeated
with little variation in most modern languages. The Italians say, "A
tree often transplanted is never loaded with fruit."[293]

  =A man may bear till his back breaks.=

  =All lay load on the willing horse.=

Patience may be abused. "Through much enduring come things that cannot

  =Cut your coat according to your cloth.=

Let your expenditure be proportioned to your means. "Let every one
stretch his leg according to his coverlet" (Spanish).[303] "According
to the arm be the blood-letting" (French).[304] "Meditating upon
general improvement, I often think a great deal about the climate
in these parts of the world; and I see that, without much husbandry
of our means and resources, it is difficult for us to be anything
but low barbarians. The difficulty of living at all in a cold, damp,
destructive climate is great. Socrates went about with very scanty
clothing, and men praise his wisdom in caring so little for the goods
of this life. He ate sparingly, and of mean food. That is not the way,
I suspect, that we can make a philosopher here. There are people who
would deride me for saying this, and would contend that it gives too
much weight to worldly things. But I suspect they are misled by notions
borrowed from eastern climates. Here we must make prudence one of the
substantial virtues."--(_Companions of my Solitude._)

  =A good bargain is a pickpurse.=

Buy what you have no need of, and ere long you will sell your
necessaries. "At a good bargain bethink you" (Italian).[305] "What is
not needed is dear at a farthing" (Latin).[306] This very sensible
proverb was bequeathed to us by the elder Cato; and a wiser man than
Cato--Sydney Smith--has said, "If you want to make much of a small
income, always ask yourself these two questions: first, do I really
want it? secondly, can I do without it? These two questions, answered
honestly, will double your fortune."

  =Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire.=

  =Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.=

One of the neatest repartees ever made was that which Shaftesbury
administered at the feast at which he entertained the Duke of York
(James II.). He overheard Lauderdale whispering the duke, "Fools make
feasts, and wise men eat them." Ere the sound of the last word had
died away, Shaftesbury, responding both to the words and the sense,
said, "Witty men make jests, and fools repeat them." "A fat kitchen has
poverty for a neighbour" (Italian).[307] "A fat kitchen, a lean will"
(German).[308]

  =Waste not, want not.=

  =Wilful waste makes woeful want.=

  =A small leak will sink a great ship.=

  =Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves.=

  =A fool and his money are soon parted.=

  =He that gets his gear before his wit will be short while master of
  it.=--_Scotch._

  =Gear is easier gained than guided.=

  =A fool may make money, but it needs a wise man to spend it.=

"Men," says Fielding (and he was an example of the truth he asserted),
"do not become rich by what they get, but by what they keep." "Saving
is the first gain" (Italian).[309] "Better is rule than rent"
(French).[310]

  =A penny saved is a penny got.=

  =The best is cheapest.=

"One cannot have a good pennyworth of bad ware" (French).[311] "Much
worth never cost little" (Spanish).[312] "Cheap bargains are dear"
(Spanish).[313]

  =Misers' money goes twice to market.=

  =Keep a thing seven years and you'll find a use for it.=

  =Store is no sore.=[314]

"He that buys by the pennyworth keeps his own house and another man's"
(Italian).[315] Partly for this reason it is that

  =A poor man's shilling is but a penny.=

  =A toom [empty] pantry makes a thriftless gudewife.=--_Scotch._

  =Bare walls make giddy housewives.=[316]

  =All is not gain that is put into the purse.=

  =What the goodwife spares the cat eats.=

MODERATION. EXCESS.


  =Enough is enough of bread and cheese.=

  =Enough is as good as a feast.=

"A bird can roost but on one branch; a mouse can drink no more than its
fill from a river" (Chinese). "He is rich enough who does not want"
(Italian).[317] But the difficulty is to determine to a nicety the
point at which there is neither want nor surplus. Practically there is
no such point, however it may exist in theory; for

  =There's never enough where nought is left.=

  =Of enough men leave.=

Where all is eaten up it is pretty certain that the commons were but
short. "There is not enough if there is not too much" (French).[318]
Beaumarchais makes Figaro, in speaking of love, to utter the
charming hyperbole which has passed into a proverb, "Too much is not
enough."[319] Even without being in love, everybody must agree with
Voltaire in considering

  "Le superflu, chose très nécessaire."

  =Better leave than lack.=

  =All covet, all lose.=

  =Covetousness brings nothing home.=

"It bursts the bag" (Italian).[320] Like the dog in the fable, it
grasps at the shadow, and lets fall the substance. "He that embraces
too much holds nothing fast" (Italian, French).[321] A statue was
erected to Buffon in his lifetime, with the inscription, _Naturam
amplectitur omnem_ ("He embraces all nature"). Somebody remarked upon
this, "He that embraces too much," &c. Buffon heard of the sarcasm, and
had the inscription obliterated.

  =It is hard for a greedy eye to hae a leal heart.=--_Scotch._

Covetousness is scarcely consistent with honesty.

  =Much would have more.=

  =A greedy eye never had a fu' weam [belly].=--_Scotch._

"The dust alone can fill the eye of man" (Arab); _i.e._, the dust of
the grave can alone extinguish the lust of the eye and the cupidity
of man. Among the Arabs, the phrase, "His eye is full," signifies he
possesses every object of his desire. The Germans say, "Greed and the
eye can no man fill."[322] The Scotch say of a covetous person,--

  =He'll get enough ae day when his mouth's fu' o' mools [mould].=

  =The greedy man and the gileynoar [cheat] are soon agreed.=--_Scotch._

"The sharper soon cheats the covetous man" (Spanish).[323]

  =The grace of God is gear enough=.--_Scotch._

This is the northern form of the proverb which Launcelot Gobbo speaks
of as being well parted between Bassanio and Shylock. "You [Bassanio]
have the grace of God, and he [Shylock] has enough."

  =Too much is stark nought.=--_Welsh._

  =Too much of one thing is good for nothing.=

"One may be surfeited with eating tarts" (French).[324] "Nothing too
much!" (Latin.)[325]

  =Better a wee fire to warm us than a meikle fire to burn us.=--_Scotch._

It is better to be content with a moderate fortune than attempt to
increase it at the risk of being ruined. "Give me the ass that carries
me, rather than the horse that throws me" (Portuguese).[326]

  =Little sticks kindle a fire, but great ones put it out.=

  =Fair and softly goes far in a day.=

  =Hooly and fairly men ride far journeys.=--_Scotch._

"Who goes softly goes safely, and who goes safely goes far"
(Italian).[327] "Take-it-easy and Live-long are brothers" (German).[328]

  =Fools' haste is no speed.=

  =The more haste the worse speed.=

This seems to be derived from the Latin adage, _Festinatio tarda
est_ ("Haste is slow"). It defeats its own purpose by the blunders
and imperfect work it occasions. A favourite saying of the Emperors
Augustus and Titus was, _Festina lente_ ("Hasten leisurely"), which
Erasmus calls the king of adages. The Germans have happily translated
it,[329] and it is well paraphrased in that saying of Sir Amyas Paulet,
"Tarry a little, that we may make an end the sooner." A thing is done
"Fast enough if well enough" (Latin).[330]

  =Naething in haste but gripping o' fleas.=--_Scotch._

  =Nothing should be done in haste except catching fleas.=

  =Haste trips up its own heels.=

"He that goes too hastily along often stumbles on a fair road"
(French).[331] "Reason lies between the bridle and the spur"
(Italian).[332]

  =Draw not your bow till your arrow is fixed.=

  =He that rides ere he be ready wants some o' his graith.=--_Scotch._

He leaves some of his accoutrements behind him. Perhaps one reason why
"It is good to have a hatch before your door" is, that it may act as
a check upon such unprofitable haste. Sydney Smith adopted a similar
expedient, which he called a _screaming gate_. "We all arrived once,"
he said, "at a friend's house just before dinner, hot, tired, and
dusty--a large party assembled--and found all the keys of our trunks
had been left behind. Since then I have established a screaming gate.
We never set out on our journey now without stopping at a gate about
ten minutes' distance from the house, to consider what we have left
behind. The result has been excellent."

  =Two hungry meals make the third a glutton.=

Excess in one direction induces excess in the opposite direction.

  =Soft fire makes sweet malt.=

  =More flies are caught with a drop of honey than with a tun of vinegar.=

"Gentleness does more than violence" (French).[333] "The gentle calf
sucks all the cows" (Portuguese).[334]

  =Ower hot, ower cauld.=--_Scotch._

"It may be a fire--on the morrow it will be ashes" (Arab). Violent
passions are apt to subside quickly. "Soon fire, soon ashes" (Dutch).

  =A man may love his house weel, and no ride on the riggin [roof]
  o't.=--_Scotch._

No one will believe that he loves it the more for any such extravagant
demonstration.

  =Many irons in the fire, some will cool.=

  =Too many cooks spoil the broth.=

  =Ower mony greeves [overseers] hinder the wark.=--_Scotch._

"Too many tirewomen make the bride ill dressed" (Spanish).[335] "If the
sailors become too numerous the ship sinks" (Arab).

  =A bow o'erbent will weaken.=

  =All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.=

"This nation, the northern part of it especially, is given to believe
in the sovereign efficacy of dulness. To be sure, dulness and solid
vice are apt to go hand in hand. But then, according to our notions,
dulness is in itself so good a thing--almost a religion. Now, if ever a
people required to be amused, it is we sad-hearted Anglo-Saxons. Heavy
eaters, hard thinkers, often given up to a peculiar melancholy of our
own, with a climate that for months together would frown away mirth if
it could--many of us with very gloomy thoughts about our hereafter. If
ever there were a people who should avoid increasing their dulness by
all work and no play, we are that people. 'They took their pleasure
sadly,' says Froissart, 'after their fashion.' We need not ask of what
nation Froissart was speaking."--(_Friends in Council._)

  =The mill that is always grinding grinds coarse and fine
  together.=--_Irish._

"The pot that boils too much loses flavour" (Portuguese).[336]

  =Play's gude while it is play.=--_Scotch._

Beware of pushing it to that point at which it ceases to be play.
"Leave off the play (or jest) when it is merriest" (Spanish).[337]
Never let it degenerate into horse play. "Manual play is clowns' play"
(French).[338]

  =A man may make his own dog bite him.=

It is not wise to overstrain authority, or to drive even the weakest or
most submissive to desperation.

  =A baited cat may grow as fierce as a lion.=

  =Put a coward on his mettle and he'll fight the devil.=

  =Make a bridge of gold for the flying enemy.=

  =Extremes meet.=

A proverb of universal application in the physical as well as the moral
world. Every one knows the saying of Napoleon, "From the sublime to the
ridiculous is but a step."

  =Too far east is west.=

  =No feast to a miser's.=

THOROUGHGOING. THE WHOLE HOG.


  =In for a penny, in for a pound.=

  =As good be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.=

  =Ne'er go to the deil wi' a dishclout in your hand.=--_Scotch._

  =Over shoes, over boots.=

"There is nothing like being bespattered for making one defy the
slough" (French).[339] These proverbs are as true in their physical as
in their moral application. Persons who have ventured a little way will
venture further. Persons whose characters are already sullied will not
be very careful to preserve them from further discredit. When Madame
de Cornuel remonstrated with a court lady on certain improprieties
of conduct, the latter exclaimed, "Eh! madame, laissez-moi jouir
de ma mauvaise réputation" ("Do let me enjoy the benefit of my bad
reputation"). "It is the first shower that wets" (Italian).[340] "It
is all the same whether a man has both legs in the stocks or one"
(German).[341] Honest Launce "would have one that would be a dog
indeed, to be as it were a dog in all things." The author of _The
Romany Rye_ learned a practical illustration of this whole-hog doctrine
from an old ostler who had served in his youth at a small inn at
Hounslow, much patronised by highwaymen.

"He said that when a person had once made up his mind to become a
highwayman his best policy was to go the whole hog, fearing nothing,
but making everybody afraid of him; that people never thought of
resisting a savage-faced, foul-mouthed highwayman, and if he were taken
were afraid to bear witness against him, lest he should get off and
cut their throats some time or other upon the roads; whereas people
would resist being robbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal, and would
swear bodily against him on the first opportunity; adding that Abershaw
and Ferguson, two most awful fellows, had enjoyed a long career,
whereas two disbanded officers of the army, who wished to rob a coach
like gentlemen, had begged the passengers' pardon, and talked of hard
necessity, had been set upon by the passengers themselves, amongst whom
were three women, pulled from their horses, conducted to Maidstone, and
hanged with as little pity as such contemptible fellows deserved."

  =Neck or nothing, for the king loves no cripples.=

Either break your neck or come off safe: broken limbs will make you a
less profitable subject.

  =Either a man or a mouse.=

Either succeed or fail outright. _Aut Cæsar, aut nullus._

  =Either win the horse or lose the saddle.=

  =Either make a spoon or spoil a horn.=

  =He that takes the devil into his boat must carry him over the sound.=

  =He that is embarked with the devil must make the passage along with
  him.=

"He that is at sea must either sail or sink" (Danish). "He that is at
sea has not the wind in his hands" (Dutch).[342]

  =Such things must be if we sell ale.=

This was the good woman's reply to her husband when he complained of
the exciseman's too demonstrative gallantry.

  =If you would have the hen's egg you must bear with her cackling.=

  =The cat loves fish, but she is loath to wet her feet.=

It is to this proverb that Lady Macbeth alludes when she upbraids her
husband for his irresolution:--

  "Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
  Like the poor cat in the adage."

"There's no catching trouts with dry breeches" (Portuguese).[343]

  =Almost and hardly save many a lie.=

"Perhaps hinders folk from lying" (French).[344]

  =Almost was never hanged.=

"All but saves many a man" (Danish).[345] "Almost kills no man"
(Danish).[346] "Almost never killed a fly" (German);[347] for

  =An inch of a miss is as good as a mile.=

This is the original reading of the proverb, and better than that which
is now more current: "A miss is as good as a mile." The French say,
"For a point Martin lost his ass,"[348] and thereby hangs a tale. An
ecclesiastic named Martin, Abbot of Asello, in Italy, wished to have
this Latin line inscribed over the gate of the abbey:--

  PORTA PATENS ESTO. NULLI CLAUDARIS HONESTO.

  "Gate be open. Never be closed against an honest man."

It was just the time when the long-forgotten art of punctuation was
beginning to be brought into use again. Abbot Martin was not skilled
in this art, and unfortunately he employed a copyist to whom it was
equally unknown. The consequence was, that the point which ought to
have followed the word _esto_ was placed after _nulli_, completely
changing the meaning of the line, thus:--

  PORTA PATENS ESTO NULLI. CLAUDARIS HONESTO.

  "Gate be open never. Be closed against an honest man."

The pope, being informed of this unseemly inscription, deposed Abbot
Martin, and gave the abbey to another. The new dignitary corrected the
punctuation of the unlucky line, and added the following one:--

  UNO PRO PUNCTO CARUIT MARTINUS ASELLO.

That is to say, "For a single point Martin lost his Asello." But
_Asello_, the name of the abbey, being Latin for _ass_, it happened, in
the most natural way in the world, that the line was translated thus:
"For a point Martin lost his ass," and this erroneous version passed
into a proverb. Other accounts of its origin have been given; but that
which we have here set down is confirmed by the fact that in Italy they
have also another reading of the proverb, namely, _Per un punto Martino
perse la cappa_ ("For a point Martin lost the cope"); that is, the
dignity of abbot typified in that vestment.

WILL. INCLINATION. DESIRE.


  =Where there's a will there's a way.=

  =A wight man ne'er wanted a weapon.=--_Scotch._

"A good knight is not at a loss for a lance" (Italian).[349] A man
of sense and resolution will make instruments of whatever comes to
his hands; and truly "He is not a good mason who refuses any stone"
(Italian).[350] "He that has a good head does not want for hats"
(French).[351]

  =Where the will is ready the feet are light.=[352]

"The willing dancer is easily played to" (Servian).[353] "The will does
it" (German).[354] "A voluntary burden is no burden" (Italian).[355]

  "The labour we delight in physics pain."

"A joyous heart spins the hemp" (Servian); and, as Autolycus sings,--

    "A merry heart goes all the day,
    Your sad tires in a mile-a."

  =One man may lead the horse to the water, but fifty can't make him
  drink.=

"You cannot make an ass drink if he is not thirsty" (French).[356] "It
is bad coursing with unwilling hounds" (Dutch).[357] "A thing done
perforce is not worth a rush" (Italian).[358]

  =None so deaf as he that will not hear.=

  =Nothing is impossible to a willing mind.=

"Madame," said M. de Calonne to a lady who solicited his aid in a
certain affair, "if the thing is possible, it is done; and if it is
impossible, it shall be done."[359]

  =Good-will should be taken in part payment.=

  =Take the will for the deed.=

"Gifts are as the givers" (German).[360] "The will gives the work its
name." "The will is the soul of the work" (German).[361]

  =Hell is paved with good intentions.=

A great moral conveyed in a bold figure. What is the worth of virtuous
resolutions that never ripen into action? In the German version of
the proverb a slight change greatly improves the metaphor, thus: "The
way to perdition is paved with good intentions."[362] A Scotch proverb
warns the weak in will, who are always hoping to reform and do well,

  =Hopers go to hell.=

  =As the fool thinks, the bell tinks.=

We are all prone to interpret facts and tokens in accordance with our
own inclinations and habits of thought. It was not the voice of the
bells that first inspired young Whittington with hopes of attaining
civic honours; it was because he had conceived such hopes already that
he was able to hear so distinctly the words, "Turn again, Whittington,
thrice Lord Mayor of London." "People make the bells say whatever they
have a mind" (French).[363] In a Latin sermon on widowhood by Jean
Raulin, a monk of Cluny of the fifteenth century, there is a story
which Rabelais has told again in his own way. Raulin's version is
this:--

A widow consulted her parish priest about her entering into a
second marriage. She told him she stood in need of a helpmate and
protector, and that her journeyman, for whom she had taken a fancy,
was industrious and well acquainted with her late husband's trade.
"Very well," said the priest, "you had better marry him." "And yet,"
rejoined the widow, "I am afraid to do it, for who knows but I may
find my servant become my master?" "Well, then," said the priest,
"don't have him." "But what shall I do?" said the widow; "the business
left me by my poor dear departed husband is more than I can manage by
myself." "Marry him, then," said the priest. "Ay, but suppose he turns
out a scamp," said the widow; "he may get hold of my property, and run
through it all." "Don't have him," said the priest. Thus the dialogue
went on, the priest always agreeing in the last opinion expressed by
the widow, until at length, seeing that her mind was actually made
up to marry the journeyman, he told her to consult the church bells,
and they would advise her best what to do. The bells were rung, and
the widow heard them distinctly say, "Do take your man; do take your
man."[364] Accordingly she went home and married him forthwith; but it
was not long before he thrashed her soundly, and made her feel that
instead of his mistress she had become his servant. Back she went to
the priest, cursing the hour when she had been credulous enough to
act upon his advice. "Good woman," said he, "I am afraid you did not
rightly understand what the bells said to you." He rang them again, and
then the poor woman heard clearly, but too late, these warning words:
"Do not take him, do not take him."[365]

  =Wilful will do it.=

  =A wilfu' man maun hae his way.=--_Scotch._

  =He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar.=--_Scotch._

Cupar is a town in Fife, and that is all that Scotch paræmiologists
condescend to tell us about it. I suppose there is some special reason
why insisting on going to Cupar above all other towns is a notable
proof of pig-headedness.

  =A wilful man never wanted woe.=

  =A wilfu' man should be unco' wise.=--_Scotch._

Since he chooses to rely on his own wisdom only.

  =Forbidden fruit is sweet.=

"Sweet is the apple when the keeper is away" (Latin).[366]

  "Stolen sweets are always sweeter,
  Stolen kisses much completer;
  Stolen looks are nice in chapels;
  Stolen, stolen be your apples!"

So sings Leigh Hunt, translating from the Latin of Thomas Randolph. The
doctrine of these poets is as old as Solomon, who says, "Stolen waters
are sweet"--a sentence thus paraphrased in German: "Forbidden water is
Malmsey."[367] A story is told of a French lady, say Madame du Barry,
who happened once, by some extraordinary chance, to have nothing but
pure water to drink when very thirsty. She took a deep draught, and
finding in it what the Roman emperor had sighed for in vain--a new
pleasure--she cried out, "Ah! what a pity it is that drinking water is
not a sin!"

"There is no pleasure but palls, and all the more if it costs nothing"
(Spanish).[368] "The sweetest grapes hang highest" (German).[369] "The
figs on the far side of the hedge are sweeter" (Servian). "Every fish
that escapes appears greater than it is" (Turkish). Upon the same
principle it is that what nature never intended a man to do is often
the very thing he particularly desires to do. "A man who can't sing is
always striving to sing" (Latin);[370] and generally "He who can't do,
always wants to do" (Italian).[371]

  =Forbid a fool a thing, and that he'll do.=

Of course; and so will many a one who is otherwise no fool. What mortal
man, to say nothing of women, but would have done as Bluebeard's wife
did when left in the castle with the key of that mysterious chamber in
her hand?

  =Every man has his hobby.=

Some men pay dearly for theirs. "Hobby horses are more costly than
Arabians" (German).[372]

  =You may pay too dear for your whistle.=

The origin of this saying, which has become thoroughly proverbial, is
found in the following extract from a paper by its author, Benjamin
Franklin:--"When I was a child of seven years old my friends on a
holiday filled my pockets with coppers. I went directly to a shop
where they sold toys for children, and being charmed with the sound
of a whistle that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I
voluntarily offered him all my money for it. I then came home, and
went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but
disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins,
understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given for it four
times as much as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I
might have bought with the rest of the money; and they laughed at me
so much for my folly that I cried with vexation, and the reflection
gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure. This, however,
was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so
that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing I said to
myself, 'Don't give too much for the whistle;' and so I saved my money.
As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I
met with many, very many who gave too much for the whistle."

CUSTOM. HABIT. USE.


  =Use will make a man live in a lion's den.=

  =Custom is second nature.=

Cicero says nearly the same thing,[373] and the thought has been
happily amplified by Sydney Smith. "There is no degree of disguise or
distortion which human nature may not be made to assume from habit;
it grows in every direction in which it is trained, and accommodates
itself to every circumstance which caprice or design places in its
way. It is a plant with such various aptitudes, and such opposite
propensities, that it flourishes in a hothouse or the open air; is
terrestrial or aquatic, parasitical or independent; looks well in
exposed situations, thrives in protected ones; can bear its own
luxuriance, admits of amputation; succeeds in perfect liberty,
and can be bent down into any forms of art; it is so flexible and
ductile, so accommodating and vivacious, that of two methods of
managing it--completely opposite--neither the one nor the other need
be considered as mistaken and bad. Not that habit can give any new
principle; but of those numerous principles which _do_ exist in our
nature it entirely determines the order and force."[374]

  =Once a use and ever a custom.=

"Continuance becomes usage" (Italian).[375] Whatever we do often
we become more and more apt to do, till at last the propensity to
the act becomes irresistible, though the performance of it may have
ceased to give any pleasure. In Fielding's "Life of Jonathan Wild"
the great thief is represented as playing at cards with the Count, a
professed gambler. "Such was the power of habit over the minds of these
illustrious persons, that Mr. Wild could not keep his hands out of the
Count's pockets, though he knew they were empty; nor could the Count
abstain from palming a card, though he was well aware Mr. Wild had no
money to pay him." "To change a habit is like death" (Spanish).[376]

  =Hand in use is father o' lear [learning, skill].=--_Scotch._

  =Practice makes perfect.=

"By working in the smithy one becomes a smith" (Latin, French).[377]
"Use makes the craftsman" (Spanish, German).[378] An emir had bought a
left eye of a glassmaker, and was vexed at finding that he could not
see with it. The man begged him to give it a little time; he could not
expect that it would see all at once so well as the right eye, which
had been for so many years in the habit of it. We take this whimsical
story from Coleridge, who does not tell us in what Oriental Joe Miller
he found it.

  =No man is his craft's master the first day.=

But some people fancy themselves masters born, like "The Portuguese
apprentice, who does not know how to sew, and wants to cut out"
(Spanish).[379]

  =You must spoil before you spin.=

"One learns by failing" (French).[380] "He that stumbles, if he does
not fall, quickens his pace" (Spanish).[381]

  =Eith to learn the cat to the kirn.=--_Scotch._

That is, it is easy to teach the cat the way to the churn. Bad habits
are easily acquired.

  =A bad custom is like a good cake--better broken than kept.=

On this proverb is built, perhaps, that remark of Hamlet's which has
troubled some hypercritical commentators, "A custom more honoured
in the breach than in the observance." An energetic Spanish proverb
counsels us to "Break the leg of a bad habit."[382]

  =At Rome do as Rome does.=

"Wherever you be, do as you see" (Spanish).[383] A very terse German
proverb, which can only be paraphrased in English, signifies that
whatever is customary in any country is proper and becoming there;
or, as we might say, "After the land's manner is mannerly."[384]
The Livonians say, "In the land of the naked people are ashamed of
clothes." "So many countries, so many customs" (French).[385] In a
Palais Royal farce a captain's wife is deploring her husband, who has
been eaten by the Caffres. Her servant observes, by way of consolation,
_Mais, madame, que voulez-vous? Chaque peuple a ses usages_ ("Well,
well, ma'am, after all, every people has its own manners and customs").

  =Tell me the company you keep, and I'll tell you what you are.=

  =Tell me with whom thou goest, and I'll tell thee what thou doest.=

"He that lives with cripples learns to limp" (Dutch).[386] "He that
goes with wolves learns to howl" (Spanish);[387] and "He that lies down
with dogs gets up with fleas" (Spanish).[388]

  =As good be out of the world as out of the fashion.=

Mrs. Hutchinson tells us that, although her husband acted with the
Puritan party, they would not allow him to be religious because his
hair was not in their cut. The world will more readily forgive a
breach of all the Ten Commandments than a violation of one of its own
conventional rules. "Fools invent fashions, and wise men follow them"
(French).[389] "Better be mad with all the world than wise alone"
(French).[390]

  =The used key is always bright.=

"'If I rest, I rust,' it says" (German).[391]

  =Drawn wells have sweetest water=;

but

  =Standing pools gather filth.=

  =Drawn wells are seldom dry.=

SELF-CONCEIT. SPURIOUS PRETENSIONS.


  =How we apples swim!=

So said the horsedung as it floated down the stream along with fruit.

  ="We hounds slew the hare," quoth the messan [lapdog].=--_Scotch._

"They came to shoe the horses of the pacha; the beetle then stretched
out its leg" (Arab). We read in the Talmud that "All kinds of wood
burn silently except thorns, which crackle and call out, 'We, too, are
wood.'" "It was prettily devised of Æsop," says Lord Bacon; "the fly
sat upon the axle of the chariot, and said, 'What a dust do I raise!'"

  =A' Stuarts are no sib to the king.=--_Scotch._

That is, not all who bear that name belong to the royal race of
Stuarts. "There are fagots and fagots,"[392] as Molière says. "It is
some way from Peter to Peter" (Spanish).[393] Great is the difference
between the terrible lion of the Atlas and the Cape lion, the most
currish of enemies; but the distinction is not always borne in mind by
the readers of hunting adventures in Africa. The traditional name of
lion beguiles the imagination of the unwary. In like manner some people
think that

  "A book's a book, although there's nothing in it."

  =Every ass thinks himself worthy to stand with the king's horses.=

But asses deceive themselves. "He that is a donkey, and believes
himself a deer, finds out his mistake at the leaping of the ditch"
(Italian).[394] "Doctor Luther's shoes will not fit every village
priest" (German).[395]

  =Many talk of Robin Hood that never shot in his bow.=

Like Justice Shallow, who "talks," says Falstaff, "as familiarly of
John of Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and I'll be sworn
he never saw him but once in the tiltyard, and then he burst his head
for crowding among the marshal's men." Southey, in his "Omniana," has
applied this proverb to that numerous class of literary pretenders who
quote and criticise flippantly works known to them only at second-hand.
A conspicuous living example of this class is M. Ponsard, who, on the
occasion of his reception into the French Academy, discoursed about
Shakspeare, and talked of him as "the divine WILLIAMS," by way of
evincing his proficiency in the language of the great dramatist whose
works he disparaged.

  =The man on the dyke is always the best hurler.=--_Munster._

The looker-on is quite sure he could do better than the actual players.
In Connaught, which is as renowned for its neck-or-nothing riders as
Munster is for its vigorous hurlers, they have this parallel saying,--

  =The best horseman is always on his feet.=

In the same sense the Dutch aver that "The best pilots stand on
shore."[396]

  =In a calm sea every man is a pilot.=

  =Every man can tame a shrew but he that hath her.=

  =Bachelors' wives and maids' children are always well taught.=

"He that has no wife chastises her well; he that has no children rears
them well" (Italian).[397]

  =I ask your pardon, coach; I thought you were a wheelbarrow when
  I stumbled over you.=--_Irish._

An ironical apology for offence given to overweening vanity or pride.

  =The pride of the cobbler's dog, that took the wall of a wagon of hay,
  and was squeezed to death.=

SELF-LOVE. SELF-INTEREST. SELF-RELIANCE.


  =Charity begins at home.=

This is literally true in the most exalted sense. The best of men are
those

            "Whose circling charities begin
    With the few loved ones Heaven has placed them near,
    Nor cease till all mankind are in their sphere."

It is only in irony, or by an odious abuse of its meaning, that the
proverb is ever used as an apology for that sort of charity which not
only begins at home, but ends there likewise. The egotist holds that
"Self is the first object of charity" (Latin).[398] "Every one has his
hands turned towards himself" (Polish).

  =The priest christens his own child first.=

  =Every man draws the water to his own mill.=

"Every cow licks her own calf." "Every old woman blows under her own
kettle" (both Servian). "Every one rakes the embers to his own cake"
(Arab).

  =Every one for himself, and God for us all.=

  =Let every tub stand on its own bottom.=

  =Let every sheep hang by its own shank.=

  =Let every herring hang by its own gills.=

  =Ilka man for his ain hand, as John Jelly fought.=--_Scotch._

James Kelly gives this explanation of the last proverb: "As two men
were fighting, John Jelly, going by, made up fiercely to them. Each
of them asked him which he was for: he answered for his own hand, and
beat them both." Sir Walter Scott puts aside John Jelly's claims to
the authorship of this saying, and assigns it to Harry Smith in the
following passage of "The Fair Maid of Perth." After the fight between
the clans at the North Inch, Black Douglas says to the smith,--

"'If thou wilt follow me, good fellow, I will change thy leathern apron
for a knight's girdle, thy burgage tenement for an hundred-pound-land
to maintain thy rank withal.'

"'I thank you humbly, my lord,' said the smith dejectedly, 'but I have
shed blood enough already; and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the contest.'

"'How, friend?' said Douglas. 'Didst thou not fight for the Clan
Chattan, and have they not gained a glorious conquest?'

"'I fought for my own hand,' said the smith indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland--meaning, 'I did such a
thing for my own pleasure, not for your profit.'"

  =Let every man skin his own skunk.=--_American._

The skunk stinks ten thousand times worse than a polecat. "Let every
one carry his own sack to the mill" (German).[399] "Let every fox take
care of his own tail" (Italian).[400]

  =Self do, self have.=

Analogous to this manly proverb, as it seems to me, is that Dutch one,
"Self's the man."[401] which Dean Trench has stigmatised as merely
selfish.

  =The tod [fox] ne'er sped better than when he went his ain
  errand.=--_Scotch._

  =The miller ne'er got better moulter [toll] than he took wi' his ain
  hands.=--_Scotch._

  =If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.=

  =If you would have a thing well done, do it yourself.=

  =Ilka man's man had a man, and that made the Treve fa'.=--_Scotch._

The Treve was a strong castle built by Black Douglas. The governor left
the care of it to a deputy, and he to an under-deputy, through whose
negligence the castle was taken and burned. "The master bids the man,
and the man bids the cat, and the cat bids its tail" (Portuguese).[402]
General Sir Charles Napier, speaking of what happened during his
temporary absence from the government of Corfu, says, "How entirely all
things depend on the mode of executing them, and how ridiculous mere
theories are! My successor thought, as half the world always thinks,
that a man in command has only to order, and obedience will follow.
Hence they are baffled, not from want of talent, but from inactivity,
vainly thinking that while they spare themselves every one under them
will work like horses."

  =Trust not to another for what you can do yourself.=

"Let him that has a mouth not say to another, Blow" (Spanish).[403]

  =The master's eye will do more work than both his hands.=

"If you have money to throw away, set on workmen and don't stand by"
(Italian);[404] for

  =When the cat's away the mice will play.=

  =The eye of the master fattens the steed.=

  =The master's eye puts mate on the horse's bones.=--_Ulster._

"The answers of Perses and Libys are worth observing," says Aristotle.
"The former being asked what was the best thing to make a horse fat,
answered, 'The master's eye;' the other being asked what was the
best manure, answered, 'The master's footsteps.'" The Spaniards have
naturalised this last saying among them.[405] Aulus Gellius tells a
story of a man who, being asked why he was so fat, and the horse he
rode was so lean, replied, "Because I feed myself, and my servant feeds
my horse."

  =He that owns the cow goes nearest her tail.=--_Scotch._

  =Let him that owns the cow take her by the tail.=

In some districts formerly the cattle used to suffer greatly from want
of food in winter and the early months of spring, before the grass had
begun to grow. Sometimes a cow would become so weak from inanition
as to be unable to rise if she once lay down. In that case it was
necessary to lift her up by means of ropes passed under her, and,
above all, by pulling at her tail. This part of the job being the most
important, was naturally undertaken by the owner of the animal.

  =A man is a lion in his own cause.=

  =No man cries stinking fish.=

On the contrary, every man tries to set off his wares to the best
advantage, to make the most of his own case, &c. "Every one says, 'I
have right on my side'" (French).[406] Æsop's currier maintained that
for fortifying a town there was "nothing like leather." "Every potter
praises his pot, and all the more if it is cracked" (Spanish).[407]
"'Tis a mad priest who blasphemes his relics" (Italian).[408] "Ask the
host if he has good wine" (Italian).[409] One canny Scot compliments
another with the remark,--

  =Ye'll no sell your hens on a rainy day;=

for then the drenched feathers, sticking close to the skin, give the
poor things a lean and miserable appearance.

  =It is an ill bird that fouls its own nest.=

  =He was scant o' news that tauld his feyther was hangit.=--_Scotch._

  =They're scarce of news that speak ill of their mother.=--_Ulster._

Why wantonly proclaim one's own disgrace, or expose the faults or
weaknesses of one's kindred or people? "If you have lost your nose
put your hand before the place" (Italian).[410] Napoleon I. used
to say, "People should wash their foul linen in private." It is a
necessary process, but there is no need to obtrude it on public notice.
English writers often quote this maxim of the great emperor, but
always mistranslate it. _Il faut laver son linge sale en famille_ is
one of those idiomatic phrases which cannot be perfectly rendered in
another tongue. Our version of it comes near to its meaning, which is
quite lost in that which is commonly given, "People should wash their
foul linen at home." The point of the proverb lies in the privacy it
enjoins, and this might equally be secured whether the linen was washed
at home or sent away to the laundress's. _En famille_ and _at home_ are
not mutually equivalent; the former means more than the latter. We may
say of a man who entertains a large dinner party in his own house, that
he dines at home, but not that he dines _en famille_.

  =No one knows where the shoe pinches so well as he that wears it.=

  =I wot weel where my ain shoe binds me.=--_Scotch._

Erskine used to say that when the hour came that all secrets should be
revealed we should know the reason why--shoes are always too tight.
The authorship of this proverb is commonly ascribed to Æmilius Paulus;
but the story told by Plutarch leaves it doubtful whether Æmilius
used a known illustration or invented one. The relations of his wife
remonstrated with him on his determination to repudiate her, she being
an honourable matron, against whom no fault could be alleged. Æmilius
admitted the lady's worth; but, pointing to one of his shoes, he asked
the remonstrants what they thought of it. They thought it a handsome,
well-fitting shoe. "But none of you," he rejoined, "can tell where it
pinches me."

  =The heart knoweth its own bitterness.=--_Solomon._

"To every one his own cross seems heaviest" (Italian);[411] but "The
burden is light on the shoulders of another" (Russian); and "One does
not feel three hundred blows on another's back" (Servian). "Another's
care hangs by a hair" (Spanish).[412] "Another's woe is a dream"
(French).[413] Rochefoucauld has had the credit of saying, "We all
have fortitude enough to endure the woes of others;" but it is plain
from this and other examples that he was not the sole author of
"Rochefoucauld's Maxims."

  ="The case is altered," quoth Plowden.=

Edmund Plowden, an eminent lawyer in Queen Elizabeth's time, was asked
by a neighbour what remedy there was in law against the owner of some
hogs that had trespassed on the inquirer's ground. Plowden answered
he might have very good remedy. "Marry, then," said the other, "the
hogs are your own." "Nay, then, neighbour, the case is altered," quoth
Plowden. Others, says Ray, with more probability make this the original
of the proverb:--"Plowden being a Roman Catholic, some neighbours
of his who bare him no good-will, intending to entrap him and bring
him under the lash of the law, had taken care to dress up an altar
in a certain place, and provided a layman in a priest's habit, who
should say mass there at such a time. And, withal, notice thereof was
given privately to Mr. Plowden, who thereupon went and was present
at the mass. For this he was presently accused and indicted. He at
first stands upon his defence, and would not acknowledge the thing.
Witnesses are produced, and among the rest one who deposed that he
himself performed the mass, and saw Mr. Plowden there. Saith Plowden to
him, 'Art thou a priest, then?' The fellow replied, 'No.' 'Why, then,
gentlemen,' quoth he, 'the case is altered: no priest, no mass,' which
came to be a proverb, and continues still in Shropshire with this
addition--'The case is altered,' quoth Plowden: 'no priest, no mass.'"

  =That's Hackerton's cow.=

This is a proverb of the Scotch, and they tell a story about it
similar to the first of the two above related of Plowden. Hackerton
was a lawyer, whose cow had gored a neighbour's ox. The man told him
the reverse. "Why, then," said Hackerton, "your ox must go for my
heifer--the law provides that." "No," said the man, "your cow killed
my ox." "The case alters there," said Hackerton. Many a one exclaims
in secret with the Spaniard, "Justice, but not brought home to
myself!"[414] "Nobody likes that" (Italian).[415]

  =Close sits my shirt, but closer my skin.=

That is, I love my friends well, but myself better; or, my body is
dearer to me than my goods.

  =Near is my petticoat, but nearer is my smock.=

Some friends are nearer to me than others. There are many proverbs in
various languages similar to the last two in meaning and in form, but
with different terms of comparison. They are all modelled upon the
Latin adage, "The tunic is nearer than the frock."[416]

"People don't give black-puddings to one who kills no pigs"
(Spanish).[420] In Spain it is usual, when a pig is killed at home,
to make black-puddings, and give some of them to one's neighbours.
There is thrift in this; for black-puddings will not keep long in that
climate, and each man generally makes more than enough for his own
consumption. "People lend only to the rich" (French).[421] "People give

Tom's generosity is like the charity of the Abbot of Bamba, who "Gives

dying bequest of another worthy of the same nation is proverbial. One
of his cows had strayed away and been long missing. His last orders
were, that if this cow were found it should be for his children; if
otherwise, it should be for God. Hence the proverb, "Let that which is
lost be for God."

INGRATITUDE.


  =Save a thief from the gallows, and he will be the first to cut your
  throat.=

The galley-slaves whom Don Quixote rescued repaid the favour by pelting
him and his squire with stones, and stealing Sancho's ass. The French
have two parallels for the English proverb. "Take a churl from the
gibbet, and he will put you on it;"[431] and, "Unhang one that is
hanged, and he will hang thee."[432] Observe the comprehensiveness of
this second proposition: it seems to embody an old superstition not yet
quite extinct, for it warns us against the danger of rescuing _any_ man
from the rope, no matter how he may have come to have his neck in the
noose. An incident curiously illustrative of this doctrine was thus
narrated in a Belgian newspaper, the _Constitutionnel_ of Mons, of July
4th, 1856:--

"The day before yesterday a man hanged himself at Wasmes. Another man
chanced to come upon him before life was extinct, and cut him down in a
state of insensibility. Presently up came some women, who clamorously
protested against the rashness, not of the would-be suicide, but of
his rescuer, and assured the latter that his only chance of escaping
the dangers to which his imprudent humanity exposed him was to hang
the poor wretch up again. The man was so alarmed that he was actually
proceeding to do as they advised him, when fortunately the burgomaster
arrived just in time to prevent that act of barbarous stupidity."

This incident will at once remind the reader of the wreck scene in _The
Pirate_. Mordaunt Merton is hastening to save Cleveland, when Bryce
Snailsfoot thus remonstrates with him:--"Are you mad? You that have
lived sae lang in Zetland to risk the saving of a drowning man? Wot ye
not, if you bring him to life again, he will be sure to do you some
capital injury?"

  =Put a snake in your bosom, and when it is warm it will sting you.=

"Bring up a raven, and it will peck out your eyes" (Spanish,
German).[433] "Do good to a knave, and pray God he requite thee not"
(Danish).[434]

  =I taught you to swim, and now you'd drown me.=

  =A's tint that's put into a riven dish.=--_Scotch._

All is lost that is put into a broken dish, or that is bestowed upon a
thankless person. The Arabs say, "Eat the present, and break the dish"
(in which it was brought). The dish will otherwise remind you of the
obligation.


  =Eaten bread is soon forgotten.=

"A favour to come is better than a hundred received" (Italian).[435]
Who was it that first defined gratitude as a lively sense of future
favours? "When I confer a favour," said Louis XIV., "I make one ingrate
and a hundred malcontents."

  =Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.=

In Timbs's "Things not Generally Known" it is related that, "In the
reign of James I., the Scotch adventurers who came over with that
monarch were greatly annoyed by persons breaking the windows of
their houses; and among the instigators was Buckingham, the court
favourite, who lived in a large house in St. Martin's Fields, which,
from the great number of windows, was termed the Glass House. Now,
the Scotchmen, in retaliation, broke the windows of Buckingham's
mansion. The courtier complained to the king, to whom the Scotchmen
had previously applied, and the monarch replied to Buckingham, 'Those
who live in glass houses, Steenie, should be careful how they throw
stones.' _Whence arose the common saying._"

It did not arise thence, nor was King James its inventor. This is one
of a thousand instances in which a story growing out of a proverb has
been presented as that proverb's origin. "Let him that has glass tiles
[panes] not throw stones at his neighbour's house" is a maxim common
to the Spaniards[436] and Italians,[437] and older than the time of
James I. The Italians say also, "Let him that has a glass skull not
take to stone-throwing."[438]

  =The kiln calls the oven burnt house.=

  =The pot calls the kettle black bottom.=

When negroes quarrel they always call each other "dam niggers." "The
pan says to the pot, 'Keep off, or you'll smutch me'" (Italian).[439]
"The shovel makes game of the poker" (French).[440] "Said the raven
to the crow, 'Get out of that, blackamoor'" (Spanish).[441] "One ass
nicknames another Longears" (German).[442] "Dirty-nosed folk always
want to wipe other folks' noses" (French).[443]

  ="Crooked carlin!" quoth the cripple to his wife.=--_Scotch._

  ="God help the fool!" said the idiot.=

  =Who more ready to call her neighbour "scold" than the arrantest
  scold in the parish?=

"A harlot repented for one night. 'Is there no police officer,' she
exclaimed, 'to take up harlots?'" (Arab.)

  =Point not at others' spots with a foul finger.=

  =Physician, heal thyself.=

"Among wonderful things," say the Arabs of Egypt, "is a sore-eyed
person who is an oculist."

FAULTS. EXCUSES. UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS.


  =Lifeless, faultless.=

  =It is a good horse that never stumbles.=

To which some add, "And a good wife that never grumbles." None are
immaculate. "Are there not spots on the very sun?" (French.)[444] A
member of the parliament of Toulouse, apologising to the king or his
minister for the judicial murder of Calas perpetrated by that body,
quoted the proverb, "_Il n'y a si bon cheval qui ne bronche_" ("It is a
good horse," &c.). He was answered, "_Passe pour un cheval, mais toute
l'écurie!_" ("A horse, granted; but the whole stable!")

  =He that shoots always right forfeits his arrow.=--_Welsh._

But in no instance was the forfeit ever exacted, for the best archer
will sometimes miss the mark, just as "The best driver will sometimes
upset" (French).[445] "A good fisherman may let an eel slip from him"
(French);[446] and "A good swimmer is not safe from all chance of
drowning" (French).[447] "The priest errs at the altar" (Italian).[448]

  =They ne'er beuk [baked] a gude cake but may bake an ill.=--_Scotch._

  =He rode sicker [sure] that ne'er fell.=--_Scotch._

  =It is a sound head that has not a soft piece in it.=

  =Every rose has its prickles.=

  =Every bean has its black.=

  =Every path has its puddle.=

  =There never was a good town but had a mire at one end of it.=

"He who wants a mule without fault may go afoot" (Spanish).[449]

  =A' things wytes [blames] that no weel fares.=--_Scotch._

When a man fails in what he undertakes he will be sure to lay the blame
on anything or anybody rather than on himself. "He that does amiss
never lacks excuses" (Italian).[450] "He is a bad shot who cannot find
an excuse" (German).[451] "The archer that shoots ill has a lie ready"
(Spanish).[452] That is rather a strong expression: the Italians, with
a more refined appreciation of the eloquence displayed by missing
marksmen, declare that "A fine shot never killed a bird."[453]

  =A bad workman always complains of his tools.=

  =A bad excuse is better than none.=

This, of course, is ironical. The Italians hold that "Any excuse is
good provided it avails" (Italian);[454] and, "Any excuse will serve
when one has not a mind to do a thing."[455] We may easily guess what
the Spaniards mean by "Friday pretexts for not fasting."[456]

  ="Who can help sickness?" quoth the drunken wife, when she lay in
  the gutter.=

  =Guilt is jealous.=

  =A guilty conscience needs no accuser.=

  =Touch a galled horse, and he'll wince.=

  =A galled horse will not endure the comb.=

"Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung," cries Hamlet,
mockingly, as he reads the effect of the play in the fratricide's
countenance. "He that is in fault is [steeped] in suspicion"
(Italian),[457] and his uneasy conscience betrays itself at every
casual touch. He is like "One who has a straw tail," and "is always
afraid of its catching fire" (Italian).[458]

  =He that has a muckle [big] nose thinks ilka ane is speaking
  o't.=--_Scotch._

"Hair is not to be mentioned in a bald man's house" (Livonian). "Never
speak of a rope in the house of one who was hanged" (Italian);[459]
or, as the Hebrew form of the precept runs, "He that hath had one of
his family hanged may not say to his neighbour, 'Hang up this fish.'"
Formerly the French used to say, "It is not right to speak of a rope
_in presence_ of one who has been hanged;"[460] and they could say
this without apparent absurdity, because it was customary to pardon a
culprit if the rope broke after he had been tied up to the gallows,
and therefore it was not an uncommon thing to meet with living men who
had known what it was to dance upon nothing. The memory of this usage
is preserved in a proverbial expression--"The hope of the man that is
hanging, that the rope may break"[461]--to signify an exceedingly faint
hope. But so much was this indulgence abused, that it was abolished by
all the parliaments, that of Bordeaux setting the example in 1524 by an
edict directing that the sentence should always be, "Hanged until death
ensue."

  =If the cap fits you, wear it.=

"Let him that feels itchy, scratch" (French).[462] "Let him wipe his
nose that feels the need of it" (French).[463]

  =Nothing was ever ill said that was not ill taken.=

"He who takes [offence] makes [the offence]" (Latin).[464] "What do
you say 'Hem!' for when I pass?" cries an angry Briton to a Frenchman.
"Monsieur Godden," replies the latter, "what for pass you when me say
'Hem?'"

  =Ye're busy to clear yourself when naebody files you.=--_Scotch._

That is, you defend yourself when nobody accuses you; and that
looks very suspicious. "He that excuses himself accuses himself"
(French).[465]

FALSE APPEARANCES AND PRETENCES, HYPOCRISY, DOUBLE DEALING,
TIME-SERVING.


  =Appearances are deceitful.=[466]

"Always judge your fellow-passengers to be the opposite of what
they strive to appear to be. For instance, a military man is not
quarrelsome, for no man doubts his courage; but a snob is. A clergyman
is not over-straitlaced, for his piety is not questioned; but a cheat
is. A lawyer is not apt to be argumentative; but an actor is. A woman
that is all smiles and graces is a vixen at heart: snakes fascinate.
A stranger that is obsequious and over-civil without apparent cause
is treacherous: cats that purr are apt to bite and scratch. Pride is
one thing, assumption is another; the latter must always get the cold
shoulder, for whoever shows it is no gentleman: men never affect to be
what they are, but what they are not. The only man who really is what
he appears to be is--a gentleman."[467]

The Livonians say, "The bald pate talks most of hair;" and, "You may
freely give a rope to one who talks about hanging."

  =All is not gold that glitters.=

Yellow iron pyrites is as bright as gold, and has often been mistaken
for it. The worthless spangles have even been imported at great cost
from California. "Every glowworm is not a fire" (Italian).[468] "Where
you think there are flitches of bacon there are not even hooks to hang
them on" (Spanish).[469] Many a reputed rich man is insolvent.

  =Much ado about nothing.=

  ="Great cry and little wool," as the fellow said when he sheared the
  pig.=

  ="Meikle cry and little woo'," as the deil said when he clipped the
  sow.=--_Scotch._

"The mountain is in labour, and will bring forth a mouse" (Latin).[470]

  =Likely lies in the mire, and unlikely gets over.=--_Scotch._

Some from whom great things are expected fail miserably, while others
of no apparent mark or promise surprise the world by their success.

  =You must not hang a man by his looks.=

He may be one who is

  =Like a singed cat, better than likely.=

"Under a shabby cloak there is a good tippler" (Spanish).[471]

  ="Care not" would have it.=

Affected indifference is often a trick to obtain an object of secret
desire. "I don't want it, I don't want it," says the Spanish friar;
"but drop it into my hood."[472] "'It is nought, it is nought,' saith
the buyer; but when he is gone he vaunteth." The girls of Italy, who
know how often this artifice is employed in affairs of love, have a
ready retort against sarcastic young gentlemen in the adage, "He that
finds fault would fain buy."[473]

  =He that lacks [disparages] my mare would buy my mare.=--_Scotch._

  ="Sour grapes," said the fox when he could not reach them.=

  =Empty vessels give the greatest sound.=

  =Shaal [shallow] waters mak the maist din.=--_Scotch._

  =Smooth waters run deep=; _or_,

  =Still waters are deep.=

This last proverb, we are told by Quintus Curtius, was current among
the Bactrians.[474] The Servians say, "A smooth river washes away
its banks;" the French, "There is no worse water than that which
sleeps."[475] "The most covered fire is the strongest" (French);[476]
and "Under white ashes there is glowing coal" (Italian).[477]

  =Where God has his church the devil will have his chapel.=

So closely does the shadow of godliness--hypocrisy--wait upon the
substance. "Very seldom does any good thing arise but there comes
an ugly phantom of a caricature of it, which sidles up against the
reality, mouths its favourite words as a third-rate actor does a great
part, under-mimics its wisdom, overacts its folly, is by half the world
taken for it, goes some way to suppress it in its own time, and perhaps
lives for it in history."[478] Defoe says,--

  "Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
  The devil always builds a chapel there;
  And 'twill be found upon examination
  The latter has the largest congregation."

The proverb is found in nearly the same form in Italian.[479] The
French say, "The devil chants high mass,"[480] which reminds us of
another English adage, applied by Antonio to Shylock:--

  =The devil can quote Scripture for his purpose.=

"The devil lurks behind the cross,"[481] say the Spaniards; and, "By
the vicar's skirts the devil gets up into the belfry."[482] "O the
slyness of sin," exclaim the Germans, "that puts an angel before every
devil!"[483] The same thought is expressed by the Queen of Navarre in
her thirteenth novel, where she speaks of "covering one's devil with
the fairest angel."[484]

  =When the fox preaches beware of the geese.=

"The fox preaches to the hens" (French).[485] "When the devil says his
paternosters he wants to cheat you" (French).[486] "Never spread your
wheat in the sun before the canter's door" (Spanish).[487]

  =A honey tongue, a heart of gall.=

  =Mouth of ivy, heart of holly.=--_Irish._

  =He can say, "My jo," an' think it na.=--_Scotch._

  =Too much courtesy, too much craft.=

"The words of a saint, and the claws of a cat" (Spanish).[488] "The cat
is friendly, but scratches" (Spanish).[489] "Many kiss the hands they
would fain see chopped off" (Arab and Spanish).[490]

  =He looks as if butter would not melt in his mouth.=

Said of a very demure person, sometimes with this addition, "And yet
cheese would not choke him." Of such a person the Spaniards say, "He
looks as if he would not muddy the water."[491] "Nothing is more like
an honest man than a rogue" (French).[492]

  =They're no a' saints that get holy water.=--_Scotch._

"All are not saints who go to church" (Italian).[493] "Not all who
go to church say their prayers" (Italian).[494] "All are not hunters
who blow the horn" (French).[495] "All are not soldiers who go to the
wars" (Spanish).[496] "All are not princes who ride with the emperor"
(Dutch).[497]

  =The chamber of sickness is the chapel of devotion.=

    =The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;=
    =The devil grew well, the devil a monk was he!=[498]

"All criminals turn preachers when they are under the gallows"
(Italian).[499] "The galley is in a bad way when the corsair promises
masses and candles" (Spanish).[500]

  =Satan rebukes sin.=[501]

  =The friar preached against stealing when he had a pudding in his
  sleeve.=

According to the Italian account of the affair the friar had a goose in
his scapulary on that occasion.[502] "Do as the friar says, and not as
he does" (Spanish).[503]

  =To carry two faces under one hood.=

To be what the Romans called "double-tongued,"[504] or, in French
phrase, "To wear a coat of two parishes."[505] Formerly the parishes in
France were bound to supply the army with a certain number of pioneers
fully equipped. Every parish claimed the right of clothing its man
in its own livery, whence it followed that when two parishes jointly
furnished only one man, he was dressed in parti-coloured garments, each
parish being represented by a moiety which differed from the other in
texture and colour.

  =To hold with the hare, and hunt with the hounds.=

To be "Jack o' both sides," true to neither. The Romans called this
"Sitting on two stools."[506] Liberius Mimus was one of a new batch
of senators created by Cæsar. The first day he entered the august
assembly, as he was looking about for a seat, Cicero said to him, "I
would make room for you were we not so crowded together." This was
a sly hit at Cæsar, who had packed the senate with his creatures.
Liberius replied, "Ay, you always liked to sit on two stools."

The Arabs say of a double dealer, "He says to the thief, 'Steal;' and
to the house-owner, 'Take care of thy goods.'" "He howls with the
wolves when he is in the wood, and bleats with the sheep in the field"
(Dutch).[507]

  =If the devil is vicar, you'll be clerk.=

  =If the deil be laird, you'll be tenant.=--_Scotch._

  =The deil ne'er sent a wind out of hell but he wad sail with
  it.=--_Scotch._

  =The vicar of Bray will be vicar of Bray still.=

Simon Aleyn, or Allen, held the Vicarage of Bray, in Berkshire, for
fifty years, in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and
Elizabeth, and was always of the religion of the sovereign for the time
being. First he was a Papist, then a Protestant, afterwards a Papist,
and a Protestant again; yet he would by no means admit that he was a
turncoat. "No," said he, "I have always stuck to my principle, which
is this--to live and die vicar of Bray." His consistency has been
celebrated in a song, the burden of which is,--

    "For this is law I will maintain--
      Unto my dying day, sir,
    Whatever king in England reign,
      I'll be the vicar of Bray, sir."

"Such are men, now o' days," says Fuller, "who, though they cannot turn
the wind, they turn their mills, and set them so that wheresoever it
bloweth, their grist should certainly be grinded."

During the Peninsular war many signboards over shops and hotels in
Spanish towns had on one side the arms of France, and on the other
those of Spain, which were turned as best suited the interests of their
owners and the feelings of the troops which alternately occupied the
place.

  =It is hard to sit at Rome and fecht wi' the pope.=--_Scotch._

Prudence forbids us to engage in strife with those in whose power we
are. Oriental servility goes further than this. Bernier tells us that
it was a current proverb in the dominions of the Great Mogul, "If the
king saith at noonday, 'It is night,' you are to say, 'Behold the moon
and stars!'" The Egyptians say, "When the monkey reigns dance before
him." The philosopher desisted from controversy with the Emperor
Hadrian, confessing himself unable to cope in argument with the master
of thirty legions.

  =There's nae gude in speaking ill o' the laird within his ain
  bounds.=--_Scotch._

On this principle Baillie Nicol Jarvie thinks it well, when passing
the Fairies' Hill, to call them, as others do, men of peace, meaning
thereby to conciliate their good-will. "Speak not ill of a great
enemy," says Selden, "but rather give him good words, that he may use
you the better if you chance to fall into his hands. The Spaniard
did this when he was dying. His confessor told him (to work him to
repentance) how the devil tormented the wicked that went to hell. The
Spaniard replying, called the devil 'my lord.' 'I hope my lord the
devil is not so cruel.' His confessor reproved him. 'Excuse me,' said
the don, 'for calling him so. I know not into what hands I may fall;
and if I happen into his, I hope he will use me the better for giving
him good words.'"

  =It is good to have friends everywhere.=

  =It's gude to hae friends baith in heaven and hell.=--_Scotch._

Brantôme relates that Robert de la Mark had a painting executed, in
which were represented St. Margaret and the devil, with himself on his
knees before them, a candle in each hand, and a scroll issuing from
his mouth, containing these words: "If God will not aid me, the devil
surely will not fail me." This is quite in the spirit of Virgil's line,
"If I cannot bend the celestials to my purpose I will move hell."[508]
Others besides De la Mark have thought it prudent "To offer a candle
to God and another to the devil" (French);[509] or, "A candle to St.
Michael and one to his devil" (French),[510] lest the time might come
when the devil under the archangel's feet should get the upper hand.
Upon the same principle a discreet person in the early Christian times
took care never to pass a prostrate statue of Jupiter without saluting
it.

=One must sometimes hold a candle to the devil.=

by never doing to-day what he could put off till to-morrow he avoided
committing himself prematurely.

  =Strike while the iron is hot.=

This proverb is cosmopolitan; but

"Cry no herring till you have it in the net" (Dutch).[524] "First catch
your hare," says Mrs. Glasse, and then you may settle how you will have
it cooked. The Greeks and Romans thought it not wise "To sing triumph
before the victory."[525] It is a rash bargain "To sell the bird on the
bough" (Italian);[526] or "The bearskin before you have caught the
bear" (Italian),[527] as Æsop has demonstrated. Finally, "Unlaid eggs
are uncertain chickens" (German).[528]

"Don't cry 'Hey!' till you are over the ditch" (German).[529] "Look
to the end" (Latin).[530] "No man can with certainty be called happy
before his death," as the Grecian sage told Crœsus. "Call me not olive
till you see me gathered" (Spanish)."[531]

  =To build castles in the air.=

To let imagination beguile us with visionary prospects. The metaphor
is intelligible to everybody, but that in the French equivalent,
"To build castles in Spain,"[532] requires explanation. The Abbé
Morellet ascribes the origin of this phrase to the general belief
in the boundless wealth of Spain after she had become mistress of
the mines of Mexico and Peru. This is plausible but wrong, for the
"Roman de la Rose," which was published long before the discovery
of America, contains this line, _Lors feras chasteaulx en Espagne._
M. Quitard says that the proverb dates from the latter part of the
eleventh century, when Henri de Bourgogne crossed the Pyrenees at the
head of a great number of knights to win glory and plunder from the
Infidels, and received from Alfonso, king of Castile, in reward for
his services, the hand of that sovereign's daughter, Theresa, and the
county of Lusitania, which, under his son Alfonso Henriquez, became
the kingdom of Portugal. The success of these illustrious adventurers
excited the emulation of the warlike French nobles, and set every man
dreaming of fiefs to be won, and castles to be built in Spain. Similar
feelings had been awakened some years before by the conquest of England
by William of Normandy, and then the French talked proverbially of
"Building castles in Albany,"[533] that is, in Albion. It is worthy of
remark that previously to the eleventh century there were hardly any
castles built in Christian Spain, or by the Saxons in England. The new
adventurers had to build for themselves.

  =Don't tell the devil too much of your mind.=

Be not too forward to proclaim your intentions. "Tell your business,
and leave the devil alone to do it for you" (Italian).[534] "A wise
man," Selden tells us, "should never resolve upon anything--at least,
never let the world know his resolution, for if he cannot arrive at
that he is ashamed. How many things did the king resolve, in his
declaration concerning Scotland, never to do, and yet did them all!
A man must do according to accidents and emergencies. Never tell
your resolution beforehand, but when the cast is thrown play it as
well as you can to win the game you are at. 'Tis but folly to study
how to play size ace when you know not whether you shall throw it or
no." "Muddy though it be, say not, 'Of this water I will not drink'"
(Spanish).[535] "There is no use in saying, 'Such a way I will not go,
or such water I will not drink'" (Italian).[536]

  =There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.=

"Between the hand and the mouth the soup is often spilt" (French).[537]
"Wine poured out is not swallowed" (French).[538] These three proverbs
are derived from the same Greek original, the English one being
nearest to it in form. A king of Samos tasked his slaves unmercifully
in laying out a vineyard, and one of them, exasperated by this ill
usage, prophesied that his master would never drink of the wine of that
vineyard. Eager to confute this prediction, the king took the first
grapes produced by his vines, pressed them into a cup in the slave's
presence, and derided him as a false prophet. The slave replied, "Many
things happen between the cup and the lip;" and these words became a
proverb, for just then a cry was raised that a wild boar had broken
into the vineyard, and the king, setting down the untested cup, went to
meet the beast, and was killed in the encounter.

  =God send you readier meat than running hares.=

  =A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.=

  =Better a wren in the hand than a crane in the air.=--_Irish_ and
  _French_.[539]

Cranes were in much request for the table down to the end of the
fourteenth century, if not later. "Better a leveret in the kitchen than
a wild boar in the forest" (Livonian). "Better is an egg to-day than a
pullet to-morrow" (Italian).[540] "One here-it-is is better than two
you-shall-have-it's" (French).[541]

  =Possession is nine points of the law.=

And there are only ten of them in all. Others reckon possession
as eleven points, the whole number being twelve. "Him that is in
possession God helps" (Italian).[542] "Possession is as good as title"
(French).[543]

  =I'll not change a cottage in possession for a kingdom in reversion.=

  =Better haud by a hair nor draw by a tether.=--_Scotch._

"He hauls at a long rope who desires another's death" (French).[544]
"He who waits for another's trencher eats a cold meal" (Catalan).[545]

  =Live, horse, and you'll get grass.=[546]

"Die not, O mine ass, for the spring is coming, and with it clover"
(Turkish). Unfortunately, "For the hungry, _wait_ is a hard word"
(German);[547] and

  =While the grass grows the steed starves.=

  =The old horse may die waiting for new grass.=

Aubrey relates that Lord Bacon, being in York House garden, looking on
fishers as they were throwing their net, asked them what they would
take for their draught. They answered so much. His lordship would offer
them only so much. They drew up their net, and in it were only two or
three little fishes. His lordship then told them it had been better for
them to have taken his offer. They replied, they hoped to have had a
better draught; but, said his lordship,--

  ="Hope is a good breakfast, but a bad supper."=

"Hope and expectation are a fool's income" (Danish).[548]

  =Hopes deferred hang the heart on tenter hooks.=

"He gives twice who gives quickly" (Latin);[549] and "A prompt refusal
has in part the grace of a favour granted" (Latin).[550]

  =All is not at hand that helps.=

We cannot foresee whence help may come to us, nor always trace back to
their sources the advantages we actually enjoy. "Water comes to the
mill from afar" (Portuguese).[551] On the other hand, "Far water does
not put out near fire" (Italian);[552] and "Better is a near neighbour
than a distant cousin" (Italian).[553] "Friends living far away are no
friends" (Greek).[554]

  =Hang a dog on a crabtree, and he'll never love verjuice.=

  =A burnt child dreads the fire.=

Fear is so imaginative that it starts even at the ghost of a
remembered danger. "A scalded dog dreads cold water" (French, Italian,
Spanish).[555] "A dog which has been beaten with a stick is afraid
of its shadow" (Italian).[556] "Whom a serpent has bitten, a lizard
alarms" (Italian).[557] "One who has been bitten by a serpent is afraid

  =Experience is the mistress of fools.=

She keeps a dear school, says Poor Richard; but fools will learn in no

Wise men learn by others' harms, fools by their own, like Epimetheus,
the Greek personification of after-wit.[561] "Happy he who is made wary
by others' perils" (Latin).[562]

  =Old birds are not to be caught with chaff.=

"Old crows are hard to catch" (German).[563] "New nets don't catch old

  =I'm ower auld a cat to draw a strae [straw] afore my nose.=--_Scotch._

That is, I am not to be gulled. A kitten will jump at a straw drawn

way.

  =Don't tell new lies to old rogues.=

  =He that cheats me ance, shame fa' him; if he cheats me twice,

  =It is a silly fish that is caught twice with the same bait.=

The French have a humorous equivalent for this proverb, growing out of
the following story:--A young rustic told his priest at confession that
he had broken down a neighbour's hedge to get at a blackbird's nest.
The priest asked if he had taken away the young birds. "No," said he,
"they were hardly grown enough. I will let them alone until Saturday
evening." No more was said on the subject, but when Saturday evening
came, the young fellow found the nest empty, and readily guessed who it
was that had forestalled him. The next time he went to confession he
had to tell something in which a young girl was partly concerned. "Oh!"
said his ghostly father; "how old is she?" "Seventeen." "Good-looking?"
"The prettiest girl in the village." "What is her name? Where does
she live?" the confessor hastily inquired; and then he got for answer
the phrase which has passed into a proverb, "À d'autres, dénicheur de
merles!" which may be paraphrased, "Try that upon somebody else, Mr.
filcher of blackbirds."

  =When an old dog barks look out.=

"An old dog does not bark for nothing" (Italian).[565] "There is no
hunting but with old hounds" (French).[566]

  =Live and learn.=

  =The langer we live the mair ferlies [wonders] we see.=--_Scotch._

  =Adversity makes a man wise, not rich.=

"Wind in the face makes a man wise" (French).[567]

  =A smooth sea never made a skilful mariner.=

  =It is hard to halt before a cripple.=

It is hard to counterfeit lameness successfully in presence of a
real cripple. "He who is of the craft can discourse about it."
(Italian).[568] "Don't talk Latin before clerks" (French),[569] or
"Arabic in the Moor's house" (Spanish).[570]

  =The proof of the pudding is in the eating.=

"Do not judge of the ship while it is on the stocks" (Italian).[571]

  =Where bad is the best, naught must be the choice.=

A traveller in America, inquiring his way, was told there were two
roads, one long, and the other short, and that it mattered not which he
took. Surprised at such a direction, he asked, "Can there be a doubt
about the choice between the long and the short?" and the answer was,
"Why, no matter which of the two you take, you will not have gone far
in it before you will wish from the bottom of your heart that you had
taken t'other."

  ="There's ne'er a best among them," as the fellow said of the fox cubs.=

  =As good eat the devil as the broth he's boiled in.=

  =Out of the fryingpan into the fire.=

To escape from one evil and incur another as bad or worse is an idea
expressed in many proverbial metaphors; _e.g._, "To come out of the
rain under the spout" (German).[574] "Flying from the bull, I fell into
the river" (Spanish).[575] "To break the constable's head and take
refuge with the sheriff" (Spanish).[576] "To shun Charybdis and strike
upon Scylla" is a well-known phrase, which almost everybody supposes
to have been current among the ancients. It is not to be found,
however, in any classical author, but appears for the first time in the
Alexandriad of Philip Gaultier, a medieval Latin poet. In his fifth
book he thus apostrophises Darius when flying from Alexander:--

          "Nescis, heu! perdite, nescis
    Quem fugias: hostes incurris dum fugis hostem;
    Incidis in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim."

  =Go forward, and fall; go backward, and mar all.=

"A precipice ahead; wolves behind" (Latin).[577] "To be between the
hammer and the anvil" (French).[578]

  =You may go farther and fare worse.=

  =To be between the devil and the deep sea.=

  =The one-eyed is a king in the land of the blind.=

  "A substitute shines brightly as a king
  Until a king be by."

"Where there are no dogs the fox is a king" (Italian).[579]

  =They that be in hell think there is no other heaven.=


  =It is good to have two strings to one's bow.=

  =It is good riding at two anchors.=

  =He is no fox that hath but one hole.=

  =The mouse that has but one hole is soon caught.= (Latin)[580]

  =Do not put all your eggs in one basket=;

nor "too many of them under one hen" (Dutch).[581] "Hang not all upon
one nail" (German),[582] nor risk your whole fortune upon one venture.

  =Comparisons are odious.=

SHIFTS. CONTRIVANCES. STRAINED USES.


  =A bad shift is better than none.=

  =Better sup wi' a cutty nor want a spune.=--_Scotch._

A cutty is a spoon with a stumpy handle or none at all. It is not a
very convenient implement, but it will serve at a pinch.

  =A bad bush is better than the open field.=

  =A wee bush is better nor nae bield.=--_Scotch._

Bield, shelter. A man's present occupation may not be lucrative, or
his connections as serviceable as he could wish, but he should not
therefore quit them until he has better.

  =Half a loaf is better than no bread.=

  =I will make a shaft or a bolt of it.=

A shaft is an arrow for the longbow, a bolt is for the crossbow.

  =If I canna do it by might I'll do it by slight.=--_Scotch._

"It's best no to be rash," said Edie Ochiltree--

  =Sticking disna gang by strength, but by the guiding o' the
  gully.=--_Scotch._

A gully is a butcher's knife. There is a knack even in slaughtering a
pig.

  =There goes reason to the roasting of eggs.=

  =Many ways to kill a dog besides hanging him.=

A story told by the African traveller, Richardson, supplies an apt
illustration of this proverb. An Arab woman preferred another man to
her husband, and frankly confessed that her affections had strayed. Her
lord, instead of flying into a passion and killing her on the spot,
thought a moment, and said, "I will consent to divorce you if you
will promise me one thing." "What is that?" the wife eagerly asked.
"You must _looloo_ to me only on your wedding day." This _looloo_ is
a peculiar cry with which it is customary for brides to salute any
handsome passer-by. The woman gave the promise required, the divorce
took place, and the marriage followed. On the day of the ceremony the
ex-husband passed the camel on which the bride rode, and gave her the
usual salute by discharging his firelock, in return for which she
loolooed to him according to promise. The new bridegroom, enraged at
this marked preference--for he noticed that she had not greeted any
one else--and suspecting that he was duped, instantly fell upon the
bride and slew her. He had no sooner done so than her brothers came
up and shot him dead, so that the first husband found himself amply
avenged without having endangered himself in the slightest degree.
"Contrivance is better than force" (French).[583] Lysander of Sparta
was reproached for relying too little on open valour in war, and
too much on ruses not always worthy of a descendant of Hercules. He
replied, in allusion to the skin of the Nemæan beast worn by his great
ancestor, "Where the lion's skin comes short we must eke it out with
the fox's."

  =It is easy to find a stick to beat a dog=; _or_,
  =It is easy to find a stone to throw at a dog.=

It is easy for the strong to find an excuse for maltreating the weak.
"On a little pretext the wolf seizes the sheep" (French),[584] or the
lamb, as the fable shows. "If you want to flog your dog say he ate the
poker" (Spanish).[585] "If a man wants to thrash his wife, let him ask
her for drink in the sunshine" (Spanish),[586] for then what can be
easier for him than to pick a quarrel with her about the motes in the
clearest water?

  =A handsaw is a good thing, but not to shave with.=

Everything to its proper use. In Italy they say, "With the Gospel
sometimes one becomes a heretic." Disraeli, and after him Dean Trench,
have given to this proverb an erroneous interpretation, founded on
a false reading. Their version of it is "Coll' Evangelo si diventa
heretico." Here there is no qualifying "sometimes;" the proposition is
put absolutely, and the two English writers consider it to be a popular
"confession that the maintenance of the Romish system and the study
of Holy Scripture cannot go together." It would certainly be "not a
little remarkable," if it were true, "that such a confession should
have embodied itself in the popular utterances of the nation;" but
the fact is that nothing more is meant by the proverb than what the
Inquisition itself might sanction. It is only a pointed way of saying
that anything, however good, is liable to be used mischievously.[587]

ADVICE.


  =He that will not be counselled cannot be helped.=

"He who will not go to heaven needs no preaching" (German).[588] "He
that will not hear must feel" (German).[589]

  =Two heads are better than one.=

"Four eyes see more than two" (Spanish);[590] and "More know the pope
and a peasant than the pope alone,"[591] as they say in Venice.

  =Come na to the council unca'd.=--_Scotch._

"Never give advice unasked" (German).[592]

  =Every one thinks himself able to advise another.=

"Nothing is given so freely as advice" (French).[593] "Of judgment
every one has a stock for sale" (Italian).[594]

  =He that kisseth his wife in the market-place shall have people enough

"He who builds according to every man's advice will have a crooked
house" (Danish).[595]

  =He that speers a' opinions comes ill speed.=--_Scotch._

"If you want to get into the bog ask five fools the way to the wood"
(Livonian). "Take help of many, counsel of few" (Danish).[596]

DETRACTION. CALUMNY. COMMON FAME. GOOD REPUTE.


  =The smoke follows the fairest.=

The original of this is in Aristophanes: it means that

  "Envy doth merit like its shade pursue."

"The best bearing trees are the most beaten" (Italian).[597] "It
is only at the tree laden with fruit that people throw stones"
(French).[598] "Towers," say the Chinese, "are measured by their
shadows, and great men by their calumniators." An old French proverb
compares detraction to dogs that bark only at the full moon, and never
heed her in the quarter. "If the fool has a hump," say the Livonians,
"no one notices it; if the wise man has a pimple everybody talks about
it."

  =Slander leaves a slur.=

"A blow of a fryingpan smuts, if it does not hurt" (Spanish).[599] The
Arabs say, "Take a bit of mud, dab it against the wall: if it does not
stick it will leave its mark;" and we have a similar proverb derived
from the Latin:[600]--

  =Throw much dirt, and some will stick.=

Fortunately

  =When the dirt's dry it will rub out.=

  =Ill-will never spoke well.=

The evidence of a prejudiced witness is to be distrusted. "He
that is an enemy to the bride does not speak well of the wedding"
(Spanish);[601] and "A runaway monk never spoke in praise of his
monastery" (Italian).[602]

  =Give a dog an ill name and hang him.=

  ="I'll not beat thee, not abuse thee," said the Quaker to his dog;
  "but I'll give thee an ill name."=--_Irish._

  =He that hath an ill name is half hanged.=

A French proverb declares, with a still bolder figure, that "Report
hangs the man."[603] The Spaniards say, "Whoso wants to kill his dog
has but to charge him with madness."[604]

  =All are not thieves that dogs bark at.=

The innocent are sometimes cried down. "An honest man is not the worse
because a dog barks at him" (Danish).[605] "What cares lofty Diana for
the barking dog?" (Latin).[606]

  =Common fame is seldom to blame.=

  =What everybody says must be true.=

  =It never smokes but there's a fire.=

"There's never a cry of 'Wolf!' but the wolf is in the district"
(Italian).[607] "There's never much talk of a thing but there's some
truth in it" (Italian).[608] This is the sense in which our droll
English saying is applied:--

  ="There was a thing in it!" quoth the fellow when he drank the
  dishclout.=

To accept the last half-dozen of proverbs too absolutely would often
lead us to uncharitable conclusions; we must, therefore, temper our
belief in these maxims by means of their opposites, such as this:--

  =Common fame is a common liar.=

"Hearsay is half lies" (German, Italian).[609] "Hear the other side,
and believe little" (Italian).[610]

  =A tale never loses in the telling.=

Witness George Colman's story of the Three Black Crows.

  =The devil is not so black as he is painted.=

Nor is the lion so fierce (Spanish).[611] "Report makes the wolf bigger
than he is" (German).[612]

  =It is a sin to belie the devil.=

  =Give the devil his due.=

  =If one's name be up he may lie in bed.=

"Get a good name and go to sleep" (Spanish).[613] So do many. Hence it
is often better to intrust the execution of a work to be done to an
obscure man than to one whose reputation is established.

  =One man may better steal a horse than another look over the
  hedge.=

"A good name covers theft" (Spanish).[614] "The honest man enjoys the
theft" (Spanish).[615]

  =A gude name is sooner tint [lost] than won.=--_Scotch._

"Once in folks' mouths, hardly ever well out of them again"
(German).[616] "Good repute is like the cypress: once cut, it never
puts forth leaf again" (Italian).[617]

TRUTH. FALSEHOOD. HONESTY.


  =A lie has no legs.=

A proverb of eastern origin, meaning that a lie has no stability:
wrestle with it, and down it goes. The Italians and Spaniards say,
"A lie has short legs;"[618] and in the same sense "A liar is sooner
caught than a cripple."[619] He trips up his own heels.

  =Liars should have good memories.=

"Memory in a liar is no more than needs," says Fuller. "For, first,
lies are hard to be remembered, because many, whereas truth is but
one: secondly, because a lie cursorily told takes little footing and
settled fatness in the teller's memory, but prints itself deeper in the
hearer's, who takes the greater notice because of the improbability and
deformity thereof; and one will remember the sight of a monster longer
than the sight of an handsome body. Hence come sit to pass that when
the liar hath forgotten himself his auditors put him in mind of the
lie, and take him therein."

  =Fair fall truth and daylight.=

  =Speak truth and shame the devil.=

  =Truth and honesty keep the crown o' the causey.=--_Scotch._

They march boldly along the middle of the roadway, which was formerly
the place of honour for pedestrians in Scottish towns. "Truth seeks no
corners" (Latin).[620]

  =Truth may be blamed, but shall ne'er be shamed.=

"It is mighty, and will prevail" (Latin).[621] "It is God's
daughter" (Spanish).[622] "Truth and oil always come to the surface"
(Spanish).[623] "It takes a good many shovelfuls of earth to bury the
truth" (German).[624]

  =Plain dealing is a jewel, but they that use it die beggars.=

"He that speaks truth must have one foot in the stirrup," say the
Turks, who are a people by no means addicted to lying. "People praise
truth, but invite lying to be their guest" (Lettish). "My gossips
dislike me because I tell them the truth" (Spanish).[625]

  =Truth has a good face, but ragged clothes.=

  =He that follows truth too near the heels will have dirt kicked in his
  face.=


Is it Charles Lamb who says that a rogue is a fool with a
circumbendibus?

  =An honest man's word is as good as his bond.=

And better than what is called "Connaught security: three in a bond and
a book oath."

SPEECH. SILENCE.


  =Speech is silvern, silence is golden.=

"Be silent, or say something that is better than silence"
(German).[626] "Better silence than ill speech" (Swedish).[627]
"Talking comes by nature, silence of understanding" (German).[628] "Who
speaks, sows; who keeps silence, reaps" (Italian).[629]

  =Silence seldom does harm.=

  =Least said, soonest mended.=

The principle applies still more forcibly to writing. "Words fly,
writing remains" (Latin).[630] A man's spoken words may be unnoticed,
or forgotten, or denied; but what he has put down in black and white is
tangible evidence against him. Therefore "Think much, say little, write
less" (Italian).[631] Give Cardinal Richelieu two lines of any man's
writing and he needed no more to hang him. Fabio Merto, an archbishop
of the seventeenth century, has oddly remarked, "It is nowhere
mentioned in the Gospels that our Lord wrote more than once, and then
it was on the sand, in order that the wind might efface the writing."
"Silence was never written down" (Italian);[632] and "A silent man's
words are not brought into court" (Danish).[633] "Hear, see, and say
nothing, if you wish to live in peace" (Italian).[634]

  =A fool's tongue is long enough to cut his own throat.=

"Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for" (Spanish).[635]
"The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf" (Italian).[636]
"He that knows nothing knows enough if he knows how to be silent"
(Italian).[637]

  =A fool's bolt is soon shot.=

"A foolish judge passes quick sentence" (French).[638] "He who knows
little soon sings it out" (Spanish).[639]

  =When a fool has spoken he has done all.=

"It is always the worst wheel that creaks" (French, Italian).[640] The
shallowest persons are the most loquacious. "Were fools silent they
would pass for wise" (Dutch).[641]

  =Silence gives consent.=

"Silence answers much" (Dutch).[642]

  =A man may hold his tongue in an ill time.=

"Amyclæ was undone by silence" (Latin).[643] The citizens having been
often frightened with false news of the enemy's coming, made it penal
for any one to report such a thing in future. Hence, when the enemy did
come indeed, they were surprised and taken. There is a time to speak as
well as to be silent.

  =Spare to speak and spare to speed.=

"If the child does not cry the mother does not understand it"
(Russian). "Him that speaks not, God hears not" (Spanish).[644]

THREATENING. BOASTING.


  =The greatest barkers bite not sorest.=

  =Great barkers are nae biters.=--_Scotch._

Those who threaten most loudly are not the most to be feared. "Timid
dogs bark worse than they bite" (Latin),[645] was a proverb of the
Bactrians, as Quintus Curtius informs us. The Turks say, "The dog
barks, but the caravan passes." "What matters the barking of the dog
that does not bite?" (German);[646] but "Beware of a silent dog and of
still water" (Latin).[647] "The silent dog bites first" (German).[648]
"A fig for our democrats!" Horace Walpole wrote in 1792. "Barking dogs
never bite. The danger in France arose from silent and instantaneous
action. They said nothing, and did everything. Ours say everything, and
will do nothing."

  =Threatened folk live long.=

"Longer lives he that is threatened than he that is hanged"
(Italian).[649] "More are threatened than are stabbed" (Spanish).[650]
"Threatened folk, too, eat bread" (Portuguese).[651] "David did not
slay Goliath with words" (Icelandic).[652] "No one dies of threats"
(Dutch).[653] "Not all threateners fight" (Dutch).[654] "Some threaten
who are afraid" (French).[655] "A curse does not knock an eye out
unless the fist go with it" (Danish).[656] "The cat's curse hurts the
mice less than her bite" (Livonian).

  =Lang mint, little dint.=--_Scotch._

That is, a blow long aimed or threatened has little force; or, as
the Italians and Spaniards say, "A blow threatened was never well
given."[657]

  =Silence grips the mouse.=

"A mewing cat was never a good mouser" (Spanish).[658] "He that
threatens warns" (German).[659] "He that threatens wastes his anger"
(Portuguese).[660] "The threatener loses the opportunity of vengeance"
(Spanish).[661] "Threats are arms for the threatened" (Italian).[662]

  =Fleying [frightening] a bird is no the way to grip it.=--_Scotch._

  =The way to catch a bird is no to fling your bonnet at her.=--_Scotch._

"Hares are not caught with beat of drum" (French).[663]

  =Let not your mousetrap smell of blood.=

  =Never show your teeth when you can't bite.=

  =Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.=

  =A boaster and a liar are cousins german.=

"Believe a boaster as you would a liar" (Italian).[664] "Who is the
greatest liar? He that talks most of himself" (Chinese).

  =The greatest talkers are always the least doers.=

  =Great boast, small roast.=

"Great vaunters, little doers" (French).[665] "It is not the hen which
cackles most that lays most eggs" (Dutch).[666] "A long tongue betokens
a short hand" (Spanish).[667]

  =Saying gangs cheap.=--_Scotch._

  =Saying and doing are two things.=

"From saying to doing is a long stretch" (French).[668] "Words are
female, deeds are male" (Italian).[669] "Words will not do for my aunt,
for she does not trust even deeds" (Spanish).[670]

  =His wind shakes no corn.=--_Scotch._

  =Harry Chuck ne'er slew a man till he cam nigh him.=--_Scotch._

Harry Chuck is understood to have been a vapouring fellow of the
Ancient Pistol order, one of those who would give "A great stab to
a dead Moor" (Spanish).[671] "It is easy to frighten a bull from
the window" (Italian).[672] "Many are brave when the enemy flees"
(Italian).[673]

  =It is well said, but who will bell the cat?=--_Scotch._

"The mice consult together how to take the cat, but they do not agree
upon the matter" (Livonian). "Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, a man
remarkable for strength of body and mind, acquired the popular name of
Bell-the-Cat upon the following remarkable occasion:--When the Scottish
nobility assembled to deliberate on putting the obnoxious favourites
of James III. to death, Lord Grey told them the fable of the mice, who
resolved that one of their number should put a bell round the neck of
the cat, to warn them of its coming; but no one was so hardy as to
attempt it. 'I understand the moral,' said Angus; 'I will bell the
cat.' He bearded the king to purpose by hanging the favourites over the
bridge of Lauder; Cochran, their chief, being elevated higher than the
rest."--(_Note to Marmion._)

  =Self-praise is no commendation.=

  =Self-praise stinks.=

  =Ye live beside ill neebours.=--_Scotch._

  =Your trumpeter is dead.=

The last two are taunts addressed to persons who sound their own
praises.

  =A man may love his house weel, and no ride on the riggen
  o't.=--_Scotch._

A man does not prove the depth and sincerity of his sentiments by an
ostentatious display of them.

  =Good wine needs no bush.=

  =Gude ale needs nae wisp.=--_Scotch._

A bunch of twigs, or a wisp of hay or straw hung up at a roadside
house, is a sign that drink is sold within. This custom, which still
lingers in the cider-making counties of the west of England, and
prevails more generally in France, is derived from the Romans, among
whom a bunch of ivy, the plant sacred to Bacchus, was appropriately
used as the sign of a wine-shop. They, too, used to say, "Vendible wine
needs no ivy hung up."[674] "Good wine needs no crier" (Spanish).[675]
"It sells itself" (Spanish).[676] "Bosky" is one of the innumerable
euphemisms for "drunk." Probably the phrase, "he is bosky," originally
conveyed an allusion to the symbolical use of the bush, with which all
good fellows were familiar in the olden time.

SECRETS.


  =No secrets but between two.=

"Where could you have heard that?" said a friend to Grattan. "Why, it
is a profound secret." "I heard it," said Grattan, "where secrets are
kept--in the street." Napoleon I. used to say, "Secrets travel fast in
Paris."[677]

  =Three may keep counsel if two be away.=

We are told in several languages "That the secret of two is God's
secret--the secret of three is all the world's;"[678] and the Spaniards
hold that "What three know every creature knows."[679] The surest plan
is, of course, not to trust to anybody; and this was the plan pursued
by Alva and by Q. Metellus Macedonicus, whose maxim, "If my tunic knew
my secret I would burn it forthwith," has been turned by the French
into a rhyming proverb of their own: "Let the shirt next your skin
not know what's within."[680] The Chinese say, "What is whispered
in the ear is often heard a hundred miles off." Truly "Nothing is so
burdensome as a secret" (French).[681] The Livonians have this humorous
hyperbole, "Confide a secret to a dumb man and it will make him speak."
King Midas's barber scraped a hole in the earth, and, lying down,
poured into it the tremendous secret that oppressed him; but the earth
did not keep it close, for it sprouted up with the growing corn, which
proclaimed with articulate rustlings, "King Midas hath the ears of an
ass."

  =Tom Noddy's secret.=

Or, "The secret of Polichinelle" (French);[682] that is to say, one
which is known to everybody. This is what the Spaniards call "The
secret of Anchuelos."[683] The town of that name lies in a gorge
between two steep hills, on one of which a shepherd tended his flock,
on the other a shepherdess. This pair kept up an amorous converse by
bawling from hill to hill, but always with many mutual injunctions of
secrecy.

  =Murder will out.=

"And a man's child cannot be hid," adds Lancelot Gobbo. The English
proverb is used jocosely, though derived from an awful sense of the
fatality, as it were, with which bloody secrets are almost always
brought to light. It seems to us as though the order of nature were
inverted when the perpetrator of a murder escapes detection. This faith
in Nemesis was expressed in the ancient Greek proverb, "The cranes of
Ibycus," of which this is the story. The lyric poet Ibycus was murdered
by robbers on his way to Corinth, and with his last breath committed
the task of avenging him to a flock of cranes, the only living things
in sight besides himself and his murderers. The latter, some time
after, sitting in the theatre at Corinth, saw a flock of cranes
overhead, and one of them said scoffingly, "Lo, there the avengers of
Ibycus!" These words were caught up by some near them, for already
the poet's disappearance had excited alarm. The men being questioned
betrayed themselves, and were led to their doom, and "The cranes of
Ibycus" passed into a proverb. This story may serve to show how

  =Daylight will peep through a small hole.=

"Eggs are close things," say the Chinese, "but the chicks come out at
last." "A secret fire is discovered by the smoke" (Catalan).[684]

  =To let the cat out of the bag.=

To betray a secret inadvertently. I cannot tell what is the origin of
this phrase. Can it be that it alludes to the practice of selling cats
for hares? A fraudulent vendor, while pressing a customer "to buy a
cat in a bag," (see p. 61,) might in an unguarded moment let him see
enough to detect the imposition.

  =When rogues fall out honest men come by their own.=

They peach upon each other. "Thieves quarrel, and thefts are
discovered" (Spanish).[685] "Gossips fall out, and tell each other
truths" (Spanish).[686] "When the cook and the butler fall out we shall
know what is become of the butter" (Dutch).

  =Tell your secret to your servant, and you make him your master=.

Juvenal notes the policy of the Greek adventurers in Rome to worm out
the secrets of the house, and so make themselves feared. "To whom you
tell your secret you surrender your freedom" (Spanish).[687] "Tell
your friend your secret, and he will set his foot on your throat"
(Spanish).[688]

  =Walls have ears.=

"Hills see, walls hear" (Spanish).[689] "The forest has ears, the field
has eyes" (German).[690]

  =What soberness conceals drunkenness reveals.=

"What is in the heart of the sober man is on the tongue of the drunken
man" (Latin).[691] "In wine is truth" (Latin).[692] "Wine wears no
breeches" (Spanish).[693]

  =When wine sinks, words swim.=[694]

  =When the wine is in the wit is out.=

RETRIBUTION. PENAL JUSTICE.


  =He that is born to be hanged will never be drowned.=

  =The water will ne'er waur the woodie.=--_Scotch._

That is, the water will never defraud the gallows of its due. Gonzago,
in _The Tempest_, says of the boatswain, "I have great comfort from
this fellow; methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion
is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good fate, to his hanging! Make the
rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he
be not born to be hanged our case is miserable."

The Danes say, "He that is to be hanged will never be drowned, unless
the water goes over the gallows."[695] Such punctilious accuracy
in fixing the limits of the proposition considerably enhances its
grim humour. There is a fine touch of ghastly horror in its Dutch
equivalent, "What belongs to the raven does not drown."[696] The
platform on which criminals were executed and gibbeted was called, in
the picturesque language of the middle ages, the "ravenstone." "He
that is to die by the gallows may dance on the river" (Italian).[697]

                "He'll be hang'd yet,
    Though every drop of water swear against it,
    And gape at wid'st to glut him."

  =Give a thief rope enough and he'll hang himself.=

  =Every fox must pay his own skin to the flayer.=

  =Air day or late day, the tod's [fox's] hide finds aye the flaying
  knife.=--_Scotch._

In spite of all his cunning the rogue will soon or late come to a bad
end. "Foxes find themselves at last at the furrier's" (French).[698]
"No mad dog runs seven years" (Dutch).[699]

  =Hanging goes by hap.=

If a man is hanged it is a sign that he was pre-destined to that end.
"The gallows was made for the unlucky" (Spanish).[700] It is not always
a man's fault so much as his misfortune that he dies of a hempen fever.
As Captain Macheath sings,--

    "Since laws were made for every degree,
    To curb vice in others as well as in me,
    I wonder we ha'n't better company
              Upon Tyburn tree."

But "Money does not get hanged" (German).[701] It sits on the
judgment-seat, and sends poor rogues to the hulks or to Jack Ketch. As
it was in the days of Diogenes the cynic, so it is now: "Great thieves
hang petty thieves" (French);[702] and, whilst "Petty thieves are
hanged, people take off their hats to great ones" (German).[703]

  =First hang and draw,
  Then hear the cause by Lidford law.=

Ray informs us that "Lidford is a little and poor but ancient
corporation in Devonshire, with very large privileges, where a Court of
Stannaries was formerly kept." The same sort of expeditious justice was
practised in Scotland and in Spain, as testified by proverbs of both
countries. At Peralvillo the Holy Brotherhood used to execute in this
manner robbers taken in the fact, or "red-hand," as the Scotch forcibly
expressed it. Hence the Spanish saying, "Peralvillo justice: after the
man is hanged try him."[704] The Scotch equivalent for this figures
with dramatic effect in that scene of _The Fair Maid of Perth_ where
Black Douglas has just discovered the murder of the Prince of Rothsay,
and exclaims,--

"'Away with the murderers! hang them over the battlements!'

"'But, my lord, some trial may be fitting,' answered Balveny.

"'To what purpose?' answered Douglas. 'I have taken them red-hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution. Yet stay: have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?'

"'Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth,' said
Balveny.

"'Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
save a little shifting for their living. Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost-martial shall do their work first: we
will have

  =Jedwood justice--hang in haste, and try at leisure.'"=

  =He that invented the "maiden" first hanselled it.=--_Scotch._

This was the Regent Morton, who was the first man beheaded by an
instrument of his own invention, called the "maiden." His enemies
thought it was

                            "Sport
    To see the engineer hoist by his own petard;"

and even those who pitied him felt that "no law was juster than that
the artificers of death should perish by their own art."[705]

  =If he has no gear to tine, he has shins to pine.=--_Scotch._

That is, if he has not wealth to lose, or means to pay a fine, he must
be clapped in the stocks or in fetters. "He that has no money must pay
with his skin" (German).[706] "Where there is no money there is no
forgiveness of sins" (German).[707]

WEALTH. POVERTY. PLENTY. WANT.


  =Happy is the son whose father went to the devil.=

On the other hand, the Portuguese say, "Alas for the son whose father
goes to heaven!"[708] the presumption being that a man does not go that
way whilst amassing great wealth; for "He that is afraid of the devil
does not grow rich" (Italian).[709] "To do so one has only to turn
one's back on God" (French).[710] Audley, a noted lawyer and usurer
in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., was asked what might be the
value of his newly-obtained office in the Court of Wards. He replied,
"It may be worth some thousands of pounds to him who after his death
would instantly go to heaven; twice as much to him who would go to
purgatory; and nobody knows how much to him who would adventure to go
to hell." Audley's biographer hints that he did adventure that way for
the four hundred thousand pounds he left behind him at his departure.
"The river does not become swollen with clear water" (Italian).[711]
According to a Latin proverb, quoted with approval by St. Jerome,
"A rich man is either a rogue or a rogue's heir."[712] "To be rich
one must have a relation at home with the devil" (Italian).[713]
"Gold goes to the Moor;" _i. e._, to the man without a conscience
(Portuguese).[714]

"The poets feign," says Bacon, "that when Plutus, which is riches, is
sent from Jupiter, he limps and goes slowly; but when he is sent from
Pluto he runs and is swift of foot; meaning that riches gotten by good
means and just labour pace slowly, but when they come by the death of
others (as by the course of inheritance, testaments, and the like),
they come tumbling upon a man. But it might be applied likewise to
Pluto, taking him for the devil; for when riches come from the devil
(as by fraud and oppression and unjust means) they come upon speed. The
ways to enrich are many, and most of them foul."

"He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent" (Proverbs
xxviii. 22). "Who would be rich in a year gets hanged in half a year"
(Spanish).[715]

  =Plenty makes dainty.=[716]

  =As the sow fills the draught sours.=

  =Hunger is the best sauce.=

"Hunger makes raw beans sweet" (German). "Hunger is the best cook"
(German). "The full stomach loatheth the honeycomb, but to the hungry
every bitter thing is sweet" (Proverbs). "Brackish water is sweet in a
dry land" (Portuguese).[717]

  =A hungry horse makes a clean manger.=

  =Hungry dogs will eat dirty puddings.=

  =A hungry man sees far.=

"A hungry man discovers more than a hundred lawyers" (Spanish).[718]
Want sharpens industry and invention. "He thinks of everything who
wants bread" (French).[719] "A poor man is all schemes" (Spanish).[720]

  "Lorgitor artium, ingeniique magister
  Venter."

"Poverty and hunger have many learned disciples" (German).[721]
"Poverty is the sixth sense."[722] "It is cunning: it catches even a
fox" (German).[723]

  =Need makes the old wife trot.=[724]

  =Need makes the naked man run.=

  =Need makes the naked quean spin.=

"Hunger sets the dog a-hunting" (Italian).[725] "Hunger drives the wolf
out of the wood" (Italian).[726]

  =Hunger will break through stone walls.=

"A hungry dog fears not the stick" (Italian);[727] whereas "The
full-fed sheep is frightened at her own tail" (Spanish).[728]

  =Poverty parteth good fellowship.=

An old Scotch song says:--

    "When I hae saxpence under my thumb,
    Then I get credit in ilka town;
    But when I hae naethin they bid me gang by:
    Hech! poverty parts gude company."

  =Poverty is no crime.=

Some say it is worse. "Poverty is no vice, but it is a sort of leprosy"
(French).[729]

BEGINNING AND END.


  =A good beginning makes a good ending.=

  =Well begun is half done.=

Tersely translated from the Latin, _Dimidium facti qui bene cœpit
habet_. "A beard lathered is half shaved," say the Spaniards.[730]
In an article on the "Philosophy of Proverbs" the author of the
"Curiosities of Literature" gives an example from the Italian, which
he deems of peculiar interest, "for it is perpetuated by Dante, and is
connected with the character of Milton." Besides these distinctions
it has a third (not surmised by Disraeli), as a linguistic curiosity;
for though it consists of but four words, and those among the
commonest in the language, its literal meaning is undetermined, and
diametrically opposite interpretations have been given of it even by
native authorities. _Cosa fatta capo ha_ is the proverb in question,
which some understand as signifying, "A deed done has an end;" or,
as the Scotch say, "A thing done is no to do." It is thus rendered
by Torriano in 1666; whilst Giusti, in 1853, explains it as meaning,
"A deed done has a beginning;" or, in other words, if you would
accomplish anything, you must not content yourself with pondering
over it for ever, but must proceed to action. Such another instance
of divided opinion respecting the import of four familiar words in a
simply-constructed sentence is probably not to be found in the history
of modern languages.

This proverb is the "bad word" to which tradition ascribes the origin
of the civil wars that long desolated Tuscany. When Buondelmonte
broke his engagement with a lady of the Amadei family, and married
another, the kinsmen of the injured lady assembled to consider how
they should deal with the offender. They inclined to pass sentence of
death upon him; but their fear of the evils that might ensue from that
decision long held them in suspense. At last Mosca Lamberti cried out
that "those who talk of many things effect nothing," quoting, says
Macchiavelli, "that trite and common adage, _Cosa fatta capo ha_."
This decided the question. Buondelmonte was murdered; and the deed
immediately involved Florence in those miserable conflicts of Guelphs
and Ghibellines, from which she had stood aloof until then. The "bad
word" uttered by Mosca has been immortalised by Dante (_Inferno_,
xxviii.), and variously rendered by his English translators. Cary
presents the passage thus:--

                                    "Then one
    Maim'd of each hand uplifted in the gloom
    The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots
    Sullied his face, and cried, 'Remember thee
    Of Mosca too--I who, alas! exclaim'd,
    The deed once done, there is an end--that proved
    A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.'"

Wright's version is,--

    "Then one deprived of both his hands, who stood
    Lifting the bleeding stumps amid the dim
    Dense air, so that his face was stain'd with blood,
    Cried, 'In thy mind let Mosca bear a place,
    Who said, alas! Deed done is well begun--
    Words fraught with evil to the Tuscan race.'"

Disraeli adopts Cary's interpretation of the proverb, and does not seem
to suspect that it can have any other. Milton appears to have used it
in the same sense. "When deeply engaged," says Disraeli, "in writing
'The Defence of the People,' and warned that it might terminate in his
blindness, he resolutely concluded his work, exclaiming with great
magnanimity, although the fatal prognostication had been accomplished,
_Cosa fatta capo ha!_ Did this proverb also influence his decision
on that great national event, when the most honest-minded fluctuated
between doubts and fears?"

  =The first blow is half the battle.=

It is as good as two according to the Italians.

  =The hardest step is over the threshold.=

"The first step is all the difficulty" (French).[731] It is well
known that after St. Denis was decapitated he picked up his head,
and walked a league with it in his hand to the spot where his church
was afterwards erected. Recounting this miracle one day in a private
circle, Cardinal de Polignac laid great stress on the length of the
way traversed in that manner by the martyred saint; whereupon Madame
du Deffaut remarked that this was not the most surprising part of the
miracle, for in such cases "the first step was all the difficulty."

  =Everything has a beginning.=

  =A child must creep ere it can go.=

"Every beginning is feeble" (Latin).[732] "'Every beginning is hard,'
as the thief said when he began by stealing an anvil" (German).[733]

  =Rome was not built in a day.=

OFFICE.


  =The office shows the man.=

  ='Tis the place shows the man.=

It tries his capacity, and shows what stuff he is made of. But it also
forms the man; it teaches him (German)[734] if he has the faculty to
be taught, so that it may be said with some truth, "To whom God gives
an office he gives understanding also" (German).[735] "A great place
strangely qualifies," saith Selden. "John Read was groom of the chamber
to my lord of Kent. Attorney-General Roy being dead, some were saying,
how would the king do for a fit man? 'Why, any man,' says John Read,
'may execute the place.' 'I warrant,' says my lord, 'thou thinkest thou
understand'st enough to perform it.' 'Yes,' quoth John; 'let the king
make me attorney, and I would fain see that man that durst tell me
there's anything I understand not.'" The proverb at the head of this
paragraph is literally translated from a Greek maxim, attributed by
Sophocles to Solon, and to Bias by Aristotle.

  =He is a poor cook that cannot lick his own fingers.=

And "He is a bad manager of honey" who does not help himself in
the same way (French).[736] The rule applies to all who have the
fingering of good things, whether in a public or a private capacity.
"He who manages other people's wealth does not go supperless to bed"
(Italian).[737] "All offices are greasy" (Dutch).[738] Something
sticks to them. Wheels are greased to make them run smoothly, and in
some countries it is found that what the Dutch call smear money may be
applied to official palms with advantage to the operator. The French
call this _Graisser la patte à quelqu'un_. "'Hast thou no money? then
turn placeman,' said the court fool to his sovereign'" (German).[739]
King James, we are told by L'Estrange, was once complaining of the
leanness of his hunting horse. Archie, his fool, standing by, said
to him, "If that be all, take no care; I'll teach your Majesty a way
to raise his flesh presently; and if he be not as fat as ever he can
wallow, you shall ride me." "I prithee, fool, how?" said the king.
"Why, do but make him a bishop, and I'll warrant you," says Archie.

A good deal of surreptitious finger-licking and fattening would be
prevented if this truth were clearly understood, that "Office without
pay [or with inadequate pay] makes thieves" (German).[740] "He cannot
keep a good course who serves without reward" (Italian).[741]

  =A man gets little thanks for losing his own.=

An excuse for taking the perquisites of office, however extortionate
they may be.

  =It is the clerk that makes the justice.=

The magistrate would often be wrong in his law if he were not kept
right by the clerk. "The blood of the soldier makes the captain great"
(Italian).[742]

  =For faut o' wise men fules sit on binks [benches].=--_Scotch._

"For want of good men they made my father alcalde" (Spanish).[743] We
do not always see the right man in the right place.

  =Never deal with the man when you can deal with the master.=

"It is better to have to do with God than with his saints"[744] is a
French proverb, which Voltaire has fitted with a droll story. A king
of Spain, he tells us, had promised to bestow relief upon the people
of the country round Burgos, who had been ruined by war. They flocked
to the palace, but the doorkeepers would not let them in except on
condition of having part of what they should get. Having consented to
this, the countrymen entered the royal hall, where their leader knelt
at the monarch's feet and said, "I beseech your Royal Highness to
command that every man of us here shall receive a hundred lashes." "An
odd petition truly!" said the king. "Why do you ask for such a thing?"
"Because," said the peasant, "your people insist on having the half of
whatever you give us."

M. Quitard believes that the saints referred to in the French proverb
are the "frost" or "vintage saints,"[745] so called because their
festivals, which occur in April, are noted in the popular calendar
as days on which frost is injurious to the young green crops and to
vines. The husbandmen, whose fields and vineyards were injured by the
inclemency of the weather, used to hold these saints responsible for
the damage they ought to have prevented, and the reproaches addressed
to them might very naturally take the form perpetuated in the proverb.
This is the more probable as it is recorded in the ecclesiastical
annals of Cahors and Rhodez that the angry agriculturists were in
the habit of flogging the images of the frost saints, defacing
their pictures, and otherwise maltreating them. Rabelais asserts,
with mock gravity, that, in order to put an end to these scandalous
irregularities, a bishop of Auxerre proposed to transfer the festivals
of the frost saints to the dog days, and make the month of August
change place with April.

  =A king's cheese goes half away in parings.=

His revenues are half eaten up before they enter his coffers. Before
Sully took the French finances in hand such was the system of plunder
established by the farmers of the revenue, that the state realised
only one-fifth of the gross amount of taxes imposed on the subjects;
the other four-fifths were consumed by the financiers. Under such a
wasteful system as this, or one in any degree like it, one might well
say that

  =Kings' chaff is worth other men's corn.=

The perquisites belonging to the king's service are better than the
wages earned elsewhere.

  =The clerk wishes the priest to have a fat dish.=--_Gaelic._

LAW AND LAWYERS.


  =Law-makers should not be law-breakers.=

Parliament has made it penal to pollute the air of towns with smoke,
and the _Builder_ complains that more smoke issues from parliament's
own chimneys than from any six factories in London.

  =Abundance of law breaks no law.=

It is safer to exceed than to fall short of what the law requires.

  =In a thousand pounds of law there is not an ounce of love.=

  =A pennyweight of love is worth a pound weight of law.=

So much more cogent is the one than the other.

  =Laws were made for rogues.=

"For the upright there are no laws" (German).[746] They are designed to
control those to whom it may be said,--

  =Ye wad do little for God if the deil were dead.=--_Scotch._

    "The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip
      To keep the wretch in order;
    But where ye feel your honour grip,
      Let that be aye your border.

    "Its slightest touches, instant pause,
      Debar a' side pretences,
    And resolutely keep its laws,
      Uncaring consequences."

  =He that loves law will get his fill of it.=

  =Agree, for the law is costly.=

  =Law's costly; tak a pint and 'gree.=--_Scotch._

Lord Mansfield declared that if any man claimed a field from him he
would give it up, provided the concession were kept secret, rather than
engage in proceedings at law. Hesiod, in admonishing his brother always
to prefer a friendly accommodation to a lawsuit, gave to the world the
paradoxical proverb, "The half is more than the whole." Very often "A
lean agreement is better than a fat lawsuit" (Italian).[747] "Lawyers'
garments are lined with suitors' obstinacy" (Italian);[748] and "Their
houses are built of fools' heads" (French).[749] Doctors and lawyers
are notoriously shy of taking what they prescribe for others. "No good
lawyer ever goes to law" (Italian).[750] Lord Chancellor Thurlow did so
once, but in his case the exception approved the rule. A house had been
built for him by contract, but he had made himself liable for more than
the stipulated price by ordering some departures from the specification
whilst the work was in progress. He refused to pay the additional
charge; the builder brought an action and got a verdict against him,
and surly Thurlow never afterwards set foot within the house which was
the monument of his wrong-headedness and its chastisement.

  =Refer my coat, and lose a sleeve.=--_Scotch._

Arbitrators generally make both parties abate something of their
pretensions.

  =Fair and softly, as lawyers go to heaven.=

The odds are great against their ever getting there, if it be true that
"Unless hell is full never will a lawyer be saved" (French).[751] "The
greater lawyer, the worse Christian" (Dutch).[752] "'Virtue in the
middle,' said the devil as he sat between two attorneys" (Danish).[753]

PHYSIC. PHYSICIANS. MAXIMS RELATING TO HEALTH.


  =If the doctor cures, the sun sees it; if he kills, the earth hides it.=

"The earth covers the mistakes of the physician" (Italian,
Spanish).[754] "Bleed him and purge him; if he dies, bury him"
(Spanish).[755] It is a melancholy truth that "The doctor is often more
to be feared than the disease" (French).[756] "Throw physic to the
dogs" is in effect the advice given by many eminent physicians, and by
some of the greatest thinkers the world has seen. "Shun doctors and
doctors' drugs if you wish to be well,"[757] was the seventh, last, and
best rule of health laid down by the famous physician Hoffmann. Sir
William Hamilton declared that "Medicine in the hands in which it is
vulgarly dispensed is a curse to humanity rather than a blessing;" and
Sir Astley Cooper did not scruple to avow that "The science of medicine
was founded on conjecture and improved by murder." It is a remarkable
fact that "The doctor seldom takes physic" (Italian).[758] He does not
appear to have a very lively faith in his own art. As for his alleged
cures, their reality does not pass unquestioned. It is true that
"Dear physic always does good, if not to the patient, at least to the
apothecary" (German);[759] but "It is God that cures, and the doctor
gets the money" (Spanish).[760] Save your money, then, and "If you have
a friend who is a doctor take off your hat to him, and send him to the
house of your enemy" (Spanish).[761]

  =The best physicians are Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet, and Dr. Merriman.=

  =Every man at forty is either a fool or a physician.=

  =A creaking gate hangs long on its hinges.=

Valetudinarians often outlive persons of robust constitution who take
less care of themselves. A French saying to this purpose, which is too
idiomatic to be translated, was neatly applied by Pozzo di Borgo in a
conversation with Lady Holland. Her ladyship, exulting in the duration
of the Whig government, notwithstanding the prevalent anticipations of
their fall, said to him, "Vous voyez, Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, que nous
vivons toujours." "Oui, madame," he replied, "les petites santés durent
quelquefois longtemps." "Creaking carts last longest" (Dutch).[762]
"The flawed pots are the most lasting" (French).[763]

  =A groaning wife and a grunting horse ne'er failed their master.=

  =Seek your salve where ye got your sore.=--_Scotch._

  =Take a hair of the dog that bit you.=

Advice given to persons suffering the after-pains of a carouse. The
same stimulant which caused their nervous depression will also relieve
it. The metaphor is derived from an old medical practice to which
Seneca makes some allusion, and which is commended in a rhyming French
adage to this effect, "With the hair of the beast that bit thee, or
with its blood, thou wilt be cured."[764] Cervantes, in his tale of
_La Gitanilla_, thus describes an old gipsy woman's manner of treating
a person bitten by a dog:--"She took some of the dog's hairs, fried
them in oil, and after washing with wine the two bites she found on the
patients left leg, she put the hairs and the oil upon them, and over
this dressing a little chewed green rosemary. She then bound the leg
up carefully with clean bandages, made the sign of the cross over it,
and said, 'Now go to sleep, friend, and with the help of God your hurts
will not signify.'"

  =One nail drives out another.=

This is the doctrine of homœopathy. "Poison quells poison"
(Italian).[765]

    "Tut, man! one fire burns out another's burning,
      One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish.
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning:
      One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    Take thou some new infection to thine eye,
    And the rank poison of the old will die."--_Romeo and Juliet._

  =If the wind strike thee through a hole,
  Go make thy will and mend thy soul.=

"A blast from a window is a shot from a crossbow" (Italian).[766] "To a
bull and a draught of air give way" (Spanish).[767]

  =One hour's sleep before midnight is worth two hours after it.=

Ladies rightly call sleep before midnight "beauty sleep."

  =Old young, and old long.=[768]

You must leave off the irregularities of youth be-times if you wish to
enjoy a long and hale old age; for

  =Young men's knocks old men feel.=

"The sins of our youth we atone for in our old age" (Latin).[769]

  =Rub your sore eye with your elbow.=

He who laid down this rule of sound surgery was a man _qui ne se
mouchait pas du talon_; he did not blow his nose with his heel. If a
speck of dust enters your eye, close the lid gently, keep your fingers
away from it, and leave the foreign body to be washed by the tears
to the inner corner of the eye, whence it may be removed without
difficulty.

CLERGY.


  =It's kittle shooting at corbies and clergy.=--_Scotch._

Crows are very wary, and the clergy are vindictive; therefore it is
ticklish work trying to get the better of either. "One must either not
meddle with priests or else smite them dead," say the Germans;[770]
and Huss, the Bohemian reformer, in denouncing the sins of the clergy
in his day, has preserved for us a similar proverb of his countrymen:
"If you have offended a clerk kill him, else you will never have
peace with him."[771] "The bites of priests and wolves are hard to
heal" (German).[772] "Priests and women never forget" (German).[773]
"How dangerous it was," says Gross, "to injure the meanest retainer
of a religious house is very ludicrously but justly expressed in the
following old English adage, which I have somewhere met with:--

  ='Yf perchaunce one offend a freere's dogge, streight clameth the
  whole brotherhood, An heresy! An heresy!'"=

There is an old German proverb to the same purpose, which Eiserlein
heard once from the lips of an aged lay servitor of a monastery in
the Black Forest: "Offend one monk, and the lappets of all cowls will
flutter as far as Rome."[774]

  =What was good the friar never loved.=

Popular opinion attributes to the clergy, both secular and regular, a
lively regard for the good things of this life, and a determination to
have their full share of them. "No priest ever died of hunger" is a
remark made by the Livonians; and they add, "Give the priests all thou
hast, and thou wilt have given them nearly enough." "A priest's pocket
is hard to fill,"[775] at least in Denmark; and the Italians say, that
"Priests, monks, nuns, and poultry never have enough."[776] "Abbot of
Carzuela," cries the Spaniard, "you eat up the stew, and you ask for
the stewpan."[777] The worst testimony against the monastic order comes
from the countries in which they most abound: "Where friars swarm,
keep your eyes open" (Spanish).[778] "Have neither a good monk for a
friend, nor a bad one for an enemy" (Spanish).[779] "As for friars,
live with them, eat with them, walk with them, and then sell them, for
thus they do themselves" (Spanish).[780] The propensity of churchmen to
identify their own personal interests with the welfare of the church
are glanced at in the following:--"The monk that begs for God's sake
begs for two" (Spanish, French).[781] "'Oh, what we must suffer for
the church of God!' cried the abbot, when the roast fowl burned his
fingers" (German).[782]

  =There's no mischief done in the world but there's a woman or a priest
  at the bottom of it.=

SEASONS. WEATHER.


  =If the grass grow in Janiveer,
  It grows the worse for it all the year.=

"When gnats dance in January the husbandman becomes a beggar"
(Dutch).[783] An exception to these rules is recorded by Ray, who
says that "in the year 1667 the winter was so mild that the pastures
were very green in January; yet was there scarcely ever known a more
plentiful crop of hay than the summer following."

  =February fill dike, be it black or be it white.=

  =All the months in the year curse a fair Februeer.=

  =The hind had as lief see his wife on the bier
  As that Candlemas day should be pleasant and clear.=

Candlemas day is the 2nd of February, when the Romish Church celebrates
the purification of the Virgin Mary. On that day, also, the church
candles are blessed for the whole year, and they are carried in
procession in the hands of the faithful. Then the use of tapers at
vespers and litanies, which prevails throughout the winter, ceases
until the ensuing Allhallowmas: hence the proverb,--

  =On Candlemas day
  Throw candle and candlestick away.=

Browne, in his "Vulgar Errors," says there is a general tradition in
most parts of Europe that inferreth the coldness of the succeeding
winter from the shining of the sun on Candlemas day, according to the
proverbial distich:--

    _Si sol splendescat Marin purificante,
    Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante._

    "If Candlemas day be fair and bright,
    Winter will have another flight;
    If on Candlemas day there be shower and rain,
    Winter is gone and will not come again."

Another version of this proverb current in the north of England is,--

    "If Candlemas day be dry and fair,
    The half of winter's to come and mair;
    If Candlemas day be wet and foul [pronounce _fool_],
    The half of winter's gone to Yule."

  =March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.=

  =March comes in with adder heads and goes out with peacock
  tails.=--_Scotch._

  =A peck of March dust is worth a king's ransom.=

  =A dry March never begs its bread.=

    =A peck of March dust and a shower in May=
    =Make the corn green and the fields gay.=

    =March winds and April showers=
    =Bring forth May flowers.=

    =March wind and May sun=
    =Make clothes white and maids dun.=

    =So many mists in March you see,=
    =So many frosts in May will be.=

  =March grass never did good.=

"When gnats dance in March it brings death to sheep" (Dutch).[784]

  =When April blows his horn it's good both for hay and corn.=

"That is," says Ray, "when it thunders in April, for thunder is usually
accompanied with rain."

  =A cold April the barn will fill.=

  =April and May are the keys of the year.=

    =A May flood never did good.=

This applies to England. In Spain and Italy they say, "Water in May is
bread for all the year."[785]

  =To wed in May is to wed poverty.=

There were fewer marriages in Scotland in May, 1857, than in any other
month of the year: it is an "unlucky month." The proverb is recorded by
Washington Irving.

    =A swarm of bees in May is worth a load of hay,=
    =A swarm in June is worth a silver spoon,=
    =But a swarm in July is not worth a fly.=

    =A shower in July, when the corn begins to fill,=
    =Is worth a plough of oxen and all belongs theretill.=

    =A dry summer never made a dear peck.=
    =Drought never bred dearth in England.=

The same thing, and no more, is meant by the following enigmatical
rhyme:--

    "When the sand doth feed the clay,
    England woe and well-a-day;
    But when the clay doth feed the sand,
    Then is it well with old England."

The first of these two contingencies occurs after a wet summer--the
second after a dry one; and, as there is more clay than sand in
England, there is a better harvest in the second case than in the first.

  =Dry August and warm doth harvest no harm.=

They think differently on this point in the south of Europe. "A wet
August never brings dearth" (Italian).[786] "When it rains in August it
rains honey and wine" (Spanish).[787]

  =September blow soft till the fruit's in the loft.
  November take flail, let ships no more sail.=

  =A green Christmas makes a fat churchyard.=

It is a popular notion that a mild winter is less healthy than a frosty
one; but the Registrar-General's returns prove that it is quite the
contrary. The mortality of the winter months is always in proportion
to the intensity of the cold. The proverb, therefore, must be given
up as a fallacy. There is some truth in this of the Germans, "A green
Christmas, a white Easter." The probability is that a very mild winter
will be followed by an inclement spring.

  =A snow year, a rich year.=

  =Under water, dearth; under snow, bread.=

  =Winter's thunder and summer's flood=
  =Never boded an Englishman good.=

NATIONAL AND LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS. LOCAL ALLUSIONS.


  =A right Englishman knows not when a thing is well.=

It would seem, too, that he does not know when a thing is ill; for the
French say the English were beaten at Waterloo, but had not the wit to
know it.

  =A Scotsman is aye wise ahint the hand.=--_Scotch._

  =A Scotsman aye taks his mark frae a mischief.=--_Scotch._

  =Scotsmen reckon aye frae an ill hour.=--_Scotch._

That is, they always date from some untoward event. "A Scottish man,"
says James Kelly, "solicited the Prince of Orange to be made an ensign,
for he had been a sergeant ever since his Highness ran away from Groll."

  =The Englishman weeps, the Irishman sleeps, but the Scotsman gaes till
  he gets it.=--_Scotch._

Such, according to Scotch report, is the conduct of the three when they

  =The Welshman keeps nothing till he has lost it.=--_Welsh._

  =The older the Welshman, the more madman.=--_Welsh._

  =As long as a Welsh pedigree.=

  =The Italianised Englishman is a devil incarnate.=--_Italian._[788]

This is the testimony of Italians. Of our country they say,--

  =England is the paradise of women, the purgatory of purses, and the
  hell of horses.=--_Italian._[789]

  =War with all the world, and peace with England.=--_Spanish._[790]

  =Beware of a white Spaniard and of a swarthy Englishman.=--_Dutch._[791]

  =He has more to do than the ovens of London at Christmas.=--_Italian._

  =They agree like the clocks of London.=--_French_, _Italian_.

Which clocks disagree to this day. (See _Household Words_, No. 410.)
"The city time measurers are so far behind each other that the last
chime of eight has hardly fallen on the ear from the last church,
when another sprightly clock is heard to begin the hour of nine. Each
clock, however, governs, and is believed in by, its own immediate
neighbourhood."

  =Shake a bridle over a Yorkshireman's grave, and he will rise and
  steal a horse.=

  =He is Yorkshire.=

He is a keen blade. "He's of Spoleto" (_E Spoletino_), say the
Italians.

  =The devil will not come into Cornwall for fear of being put into a pie.=

Cornish housewives make pies of such unlikely materials as potatoes,
pilchards, &c.

    =By Tre, Pol, and Pen,=
    =You shall know the Cornish men.=

Surnames beginning with these syllables--_e.g._, Trelawney, Polwhele,
Penrose--are originally Cornish.

  =A Scottish man and a Newcastle grindstone travel all the world
  over.=

Newcastle grindstones were long reputed the best of their kind. Another
version of the proverb associates them with rats and red herrings,
things which are very widely diffused over the globe, but not more so
than Scotchmen.

  =Three great evils come out of the north--a cold wind, a cunning
  knave, and a shrinking cloth.=

  =He's an Aberdeen's man; he may take his word again.=--_Scotch._

  =An Aberdeen's man ne'er stands to the word that hurts him.=--_Scotch._

The people of Normandy labour under the same imputation: "A Norman has
his say and his unsay."[792] This proverb is said to have arisen out of
the ancient custom of the province, according to which contracts did
not become valid until twenty-four hours after they had been signed,
and either party was at liberty to retract during that interval.

  =Wise men of Gotham.=

Gotham is a village in Nottinghamshire, declared by universal consent,
for reasons unknown, to be the head quarters of stupidity in this
country, on whose inhabitants all sorts of ridiculous stories might
be fathered. The convenience of having such a butt for sarcasm has
been recognised by all nations. The ancient Greeks had their Bœotia,
which was for them what Swabia is for the modern Germans. The Italians
compare foolish people to those of Zago, "Who sowed needles that they
might have a crop of crowbars, and dunged the steeple to make it
grow."[793] The French say, "Ninety-nine sheep and a Champenese make a
round hundred,"[794] the man being a stupid animal like the rest. The
Abbé Tuet traces back the origin of this story to Cæsar's conquest of
Gaul. Before that period the wealth of Champagne consisted in flocks of
sheep, which paid a rate in kind to the public revenue. The conqueror,
wishing to favour the staple of the province, exempted from taxation
all flocks numbering less than a hundred head, and the consequence
was that the Champenese always divided their sheep into flocks of
ninety-nine. But Cæsar was soon even with them, for he ordered that in
future the shepherd of every flock should be counted as a sheep, and
pay as one.

  =Tenterden steeple's the cause of the Goodwin Sands.=

This proposition is commonly quoted as a flagrant example of bad logic,
illustrating the fallacy of the reference _post hoc, ergo propter hoc_.
A very quaint account of its origin is given in these words in one of
Latimer's sermons:--"Mr. Moore was once sent with commission into Kent,
to try out, if it might be, what was the cause of Goodwin's Sands, and
the shelf which stopped up Sandwich Haven. Thither cometh Mr. Moore,
and calleth all the country before him; such as were thought to be men
of experience, and men that could of likelihood best satisfy him of the
matter concerning the stopping of Sandwich Haven. Among the rest came
in before him an old man with a white head, and one that was thought to
be little less than an hundred years old. When Mr. Moore saw this aged
man he thought it expedient to hear him say his mind in this matter;
for, being so old a man, it was likely that he knew most in that
presence, or company. So Mr. Moore called this old aged man unto him,
and said, 'Father, tell me, if you can, what is the cause of the great
arising of the sands and shelves here about this haven, which stop it
up so that no ships can arrive here. You are the oldest man I can espy
in all the company, so that if any man can tell the cause of it, you
of all likelihood can say most to it, or at leastwise more than any
man here assembled.' 'Yea, forsooth, good Mr. Moore,' quoth this old
man, 'for I am well-nigh an hundred years old, and no man here in this
company anything near my age.' 'Well, then,' quoth Mr. Moore, 'how say
you to this matter? What think you to be the cause of these shelves
and sands, which stop up Sandwich Haven?' 'Forsooth, sir,' quoth he,
'I am an old man; I think that Tenterton steeple is the cause of
Goodwin's Sands. For I am an old man, sir,' quoth he; 'I may remember
the building of Tenterton steeple, and I may remember when there was no
steeple at all there. And before that Tenterton steeple was in building
there was no manner of talking of any flats or sands that stopped up
the haven; and therefore I think that Tenterton steeple is the cause of
the decay and destroying of Sandwich Haven.'"

After all, this is not so palpable a _non sequitur_ as it appears,
for, says Fuller, "One story is good till another is told; and though
this be all whereupon this proverb is generally grounded, I met since
with a supplement thereunto: it is this. Time out of mind, money was
constantly collected out of this county to fence the east banks thereof
against the irruption of the sea, and such sums were deposited in the
hands of the Bishop of Rochester; but because the sea had been quiet
for many years without any encroaching, the bishop commuted this money
to the building of a steeple and endowing a church at Tenterden. By
this diversion of the collection for the maintenance of the banks, the
sea afterwards broke in upon Goodwin Sands. And now the old man had
told a rational tale, had he found but the due favour to finish it; and
thus, sometimes, that is causelessly accounted ignorance of the speaker
which is nothing but impatience in the auditors, unwilling to attend
to the end of the discourse."

  =A loyal heart may be landed under Traitors' Bridge.=

Every one who has passed down the Thames from London Bridge knows that
archway in front of the Tower, under which boats conveying prisoners of
state used to pass to Traitors' Stairs.

    =A knight of Cales, a gentleman of Wales, and a laird of the north
                                                            countree;=
    =A yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent, will buy them out all
                                                              three.=

"Cales knights were made in that voyage by Robert, Earl of Essex, to
the number of sixty, whereof (though many of great birth) some were
of low fortunes; and therefore Queen Elizabeth was half offended with
the earl for making knighthood so common. Of the numerousness of Welsh
gentlemen nothing need be said, the Welsh generally pretending to
gentility. Northern lairds are such who in Scotland hold lands in chief
of the king, whereof some have no great revenue. So that a Kentish
yeoman (by the help of a hyperbole) may countervail," &c.--(_Fuller._)
"A Spanish don, a German count, a French marquis, an Italian bishop, a
Neapolitan cavalier, a Portuguese hidalgo, and a Hungarian noble make
up a so-so company" (Italian).[795]

  =The Italians are wise before the fact, the Germans in the fact, the
  French after the fact.=--_Italian._[796]

  =The Italians are known by their singing, the French by their
  dancing, the Spaniards by their lording it, and the Germans
  by their drinking.=--_Italian._[797]

  =Where Germans are, Italians like not to be.=--_Italian._[798]

  =Italy, heads, holidays, and tempests.=--_Italian._[799]

A gentleman, who visited Dublin in the O'Connell times, gave it as
the result of his experience there that Ireland was a land of groans,
grievances, and invitations to dinner.

  =He that has to do with a Tuscan must not be blind.=--_Italian._[800]

There is a double meaning in the original. The same Italian word means
Tuscan and poison.

  =It is better to be in the forest and eat pine cones than to live in a
  castle with Spaniards.=--_Italian._[801]

Because the frugal Spanish soldiers could subsist on diet on which men
of other nations would starve. For them "Bread and radishes were a
heavenly dinner" (Spanish).[802]

  =Abstract from Spaniard all his good qualities, and there remains
  a Portuguese.=--_Spanish._

  =Every layman in Castile might make a king, every clerk a
  pope.=--_Spanish._

If the overweening pride of the Spaniard appears in these two proverbs,
the candour of the following must also be acknowledged:--

  =Succours of Spain, either late or never.=--_Spanish._[803]

  =Things of Spain.=--_Spanish._[804]

That is, abuses, anomalies, and faults of all kinds. See "Ford's
Handbook," _passim_.

  =When the Spaniard sings, either he is mad or he has not a
  doit.=--_Spanish._[805]

  =A Pole would rather steal a horse on Sunday than eat milk or
  butter on Friday.=--_German._[806]

  =Poland is the hell of peasants, the paradise of Jews, the purgatory
  of burghers, the heaven of nobles, and the gold mine of
  foreigners.=--_German._[807]

  =A Polish bridge, a Bohemian monk, a Swabian nun, Italian devotion,
  and German fasting are worth a bean.=--_German._[808]

  =If the devil came out of hell to fight there would forthwith be a
  Frenchman to accept the challenge.=--_French._[809]

  =When the Frenchman sleeps the devil rocks him.=--_French._[810]

  =The Italians weep, the Germans screech, and the French
  sing.=--_French._[811]

This is found word for word in Italian also, though it seems devised
for the special glorification of Frenchmen. The Portuguese say,--

  =The Frenchman sings well when his throat is
  moistened.=--_Portuguese._[812]

  =The Germans have their wit in their fingers.=--_French._[813]

That means they are skilful workmen.

  =The emperor of Germany is the king of kings, the king of Spain king
  of men, the king of France king of asses, the king of England
  king of devils.=--_French._[814]

  =It is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse creep.=

This was the proverb of the Douglases, adopted by every Border chief
to express, as Sir Walter Scott observes, what the great Bruce had
pointed out--that the woods and hills were the safest bulwarks of their
country, instead of the fortified places which the English surpassed
their neighbours in the art of assaulting or defending. The Servians
have a similar saying: "Better to look from the mountain than from the
dungeon."

  =He that has missed seeing Seville has missed seeing a
  marvel.=--_Spanish._[815]

  =See Naples and die.=--_Italian._[816]

  =There is but one Paris.=--_French._[817]
